Recent highlights have included the release of a series of updates to Parsley, a small molecule force field for biomolecular simulation, which is now at version OpenFF-1.2.0. Parsley was iteratively optimized to improve agreement with quantum chemical geometries, energetics, and vibrational frequencies.
Here, we provide a preliminary benchmark assessment of several small molecule force fields (FF) compared to quantum mechanical (QM) results regarding gas phase energies and geometries of a set of molecule conformers.</description></item><item><title>Lee-Ping Wang stepping down from a leadership role</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/lpw-stepdown/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/lpw-stepdown/</guid><description>From August 1, the Open Force Field Initiative will undergo a change in the leadership team, as Lee-Ping Wang has decided to step down from his role as an OpenFF primary investigator. This not a farewell, but a change of roles and Dr. Wang will remain actively involved in OpenFF research efforts as a co-investigator. The Open Force Field Initiative owes a great deal of its success to the work done by Dr.</description></item><item><title>Open Force Field Consortium Virtual Meeting</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/may-2020-virtual-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/may-2020-virtual-meeting/</guid><description>We are hosting the Third Open Force Field Consortium Workshop, this time in the online world of Zoom, on May 4-5, 2020. This virtual meeting is replacing the planned in-person gathering in Boston. We decided to slightly experiment with the workshop format by making most of the content available before the meeting for asynchronous consumption. Namely, all talks will be pre-recorded and the meeting time will be focused on discussions around those talks and future planning.</description></item><item><title>Open Force Field Initiative receives NIH funding</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/openff-nih-funding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/openff-nih-funding/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that the NIH Institute of General Medical Sciences has funded our Focused Technology Research &amp;amp; Development R01 proposal, enabling the Open Force Field Initiative to partner with the biopolymer force field community and extend our infrastructure and force fields to also cover biopolymers. This is a collaborative NIH grant, with $380K direct costs/year for four years shared over the five main academic sites (University of Colorado Boulder, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, University of California, San Diego, and University of California, Davis), and includes significant funded collaborations with the MolSSI QCArchive and the AMBER community (via David Cerutti at Rutgers).</description></item><item><title>The Third Open Force Field Consortium Workshop</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/may2020-meeting-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/may2020-meeting-announcement/</guid><description>The in-person meeting in Boston has been cancelled due to COVID-19 outbreak.

We are excited to announce the Third Open Force Field Consortium Workshop on May 4-5, 2020! This time we meet in Cambridge, MA and the venue has been generously provided by Pfizer, Inc.</description></item><item><title>The Open Force Field 1.0 small molecule force field, our first optimized force field (codename "Parsley")</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/</guid><description>We’re delighted to announce the release of &amp;ldquo;Parsley&amp;rdquo;, the Open Force Field 1.0 small molecule force field&amp;mdash;the first in a series of iteratively-improved small molecule force fields for biomolecular simulation funded in part by the Open Force Field Consortium. This is the first optimized force field to use the SMIRNOFF force field specification for atom type-free direct chemical perception, and provides substantially improved valence (bond, angle, and torsion) parameters relative to its predecessor, the AMBER-lineage SMIRNOFF99Frosst.</description></item><item><title>Aug 2019 Open Force Field Consortium Workshop</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/aug-2019-meeting-announcement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/aug-2019-meeting-announcement/</guid><description>We are hosting the Second Open Force Field Consortium Workshop in La Jolla, CA on August 30-31, 2019. The first two days of the workshop will focus on the progress update and future planning of OpenFF efforts in Year 2. The third day (Sep 1) is reserved for OpenFF team discussions, but open to interested Industry Partners. The event will be again hosted at UCSD campus, but please note that the venue has been relocated from Jacobs Medical Center used in January to the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences building.</description></item><item><title>Jan 2019 Open Force Field Consortium Workshop</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/jan-2019-meeting-agenda/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/jan-2019-meeting-agenda/</guid><description>We hosted the first Open Force Field Consortium Workshop in La Jolla, CA on January 7-8, 2019.

MolSSI fellow Caitlin Bannan will talk about the Initiative&amp;rsquo;s overall goals and her work on learned chemical perception. Register through BioExcel, or if you can&amp;rsquo;t make it, video should be available afterwards.
Bannan&amp;rsquo;s Abstract: The Open Force Field Initiative is developing a machinery to automatically parameterize molecular mechanics force fields. An important part of this process will be automating chemical perception — the way force field parameters are assigned to a molecule based on chemical environment.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Open Force Field Consortium</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/</guid><description>We’re excited to announce the launch of the Open Force Field Consortium, an academic-industry collaboration designed to improve small molecule force fields used to guide pharmaceutical drug discovery. The Open Force Field Initiative is what we are calling our overall research effort, whereas the Open Force Field Consortium refers specifically to the academic-industry collaboration.
Modeling tools based on force fields assist development of therapies for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease throughout academia and industry.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Open Force Field Initiative</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-initiative/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-initiative/</guid><description>Molecular modeling is widely used in diverse pharmaceutical discovery applications, but its utility and predictive power is limited by the accuracy of the underlying molecular mechanics force field used to compute the energetics of biomolecular systems. The Open Force Field Initiative is an open effort to build iteratively more accurate force fields to improve predictive design, along with the necessary infrastructure to make these force fields easier to build and use, and to provide a modern platform for powering force field science.</description></item></channel></rss>
