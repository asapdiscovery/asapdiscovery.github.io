Recent highlights have included the release of a series of updates to Parsley, a small molecule force field for biomolecular simulation, which is now at version OpenFF-1.2.0. Parsley was iteratively optimized to improve agreement with quantum chemical geometries, energetics, and vibrational frequencies.
Here, we provide a preliminary benchmark assessment of several small molecule force fields (FF) compared to quantum mechanical (QM) results regarding gas phase energies and geometries of a set of molecule conformers.</description></item><item><title>Lee-Ping Wang stepping down from a leadership role</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/news/lpw-stepdown/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/news/lpw-stepdown/</guid><description>From August 1, the Open Force Field Initiative will undergo a change in the leadership team, as Lee-Ping Wang has decided to step down from his role as an OpenFF primary investigator.

Currently, the HCT, OBC1, and OBC2 models (corresponding to AMBER keywords igb=1, 2, and 5, respectively) are supported, with the OBC2 implementation being the most flexible. Unfortunately, systems produced using these keywords are not yet transferable to other simulation packages via ParmEd, so users are restricted to using OpenMM to simulate systems with GBSA.
OFFXML files containing GBSA parameter definitions are available, and can be loaded in addition to existing parameter sets, for example, with the command:</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Aug 08, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-08-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-08-08/</guid><description>Datasets: Still waiting for NIST approval for data release from ThermoML.

Datasets: Y. Qiu reported on the current status of QM data generation and parameter fitting. Currently, the two major datasets are the “Roche” set, and the “coverage” set. QM calculations on these sets have been scheduled to generate optimized geometries, torsion energy profiles, and hessians for each molecule.</description></item><item><title>Release-1 update (Jul 16, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/release-1-update-2019-07-16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/release-1-update-2019-07-16/</guid><description>Types We will use the same typing tree as smirnoff99Frosst (with some minor adjustments to specific bugs or other problems), but optimize the differentiable parameters in (a subset of) torsion, valence, and Lennard-Jones parameters.
Parameterization: We will aim to refit (a subset of) torsions, valence terms, and Lennard-Jones parameters, depending on what is ready in time. In practice, we have decoupled efforts to fit all three that should be straightforward to couple together in our final optimization stage.</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Jul 11, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-11/</guid><description>Dataset sources
NIST update: Data that was collected and curated in an automated process by NIST could be released as an open dataset, but not the manually curated uncertainties, which is the step that follows automated curation. Additional problem may arise from the fact that data from before 10 years ago simply isn’t present in ThermoML. Until the situation is clear from the legal perspective, it has been decided to move forward using the data from an older release of ThermoML which contained author-assigned uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Jul 9, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/torsion-meeting-2019-07-09/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/torsion-meeting-2019-07-09/</guid><description>Fragmenter: C. Stern is working making fragmenter more interoperable and more suitable for an automated pipeline. Some of the features include using Omega to identify rotatable bonds and Wiberg bond order computations.
QC datasets: The &amp;ldquo;Roche set&amp;rdquo; (468 molecules) is almost done in terms of generating QC data for initial round of fitting with ForceBalance.

Smith suggested having a schema defined for TorsionDrive jobs for future use, to facilitate using it in larger project infrastructure.
Torsion/Valence Fitting: There was discussion of when fitting with ForceBalance might start. L.-P.

J. Chodera suggested the D3R Grand Challenge set as a starting point, but it needs to be filtered to remove any structures that might make benchmarking more complicated. For example, the structures with binding sites containing metals or histidines, titratable ligands that might change protonation states upon binding, buried sites, protein dimers, etc.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Apr 30, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/torsion-meeting-2019-04-30/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/torsion-meeting-2019-04-30/</guid><description>QCFractal: This meeting focused on technical details of how our initial dataset for parameter fitting will be generated.

There is a number of decisions that have to be made with respect to input/output requirements, handling different rates of convergence between different systems, how to define and reach targeted uncertainties etc. The current plan envisages the following solutions:
PropertyCalculator would run a simulation in a loop and pause at given intervals to check for convergence and return value, associated uncertainties and location of data files, which is necessary for reweighting, but it will be implemented later on; Initial analysis implementation will involve independent simulations instead of an ensemble analysis to meet a target uncertainty (per-window uncertainty); Returning gradients will be an optional argument, probably in the second generation of fitting with reweighting; As a job input, the estimator should receive a ForceField object and a description of the measured chemical mixture and conditions that it will estimate.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Feb 5, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/torsion-meeting-2019-02-05/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/torsion-meeting-2019-02-05/</guid><description>Conformer Generation: C. Stern found that a better way of atom mapping is necessary to keep track of the original map after fragmentation, because sometimes indexed SMILES get re-indexed after fragmentation, which results with the loss of the original map. Occasionally, certain groups that should remain whole end up fragmented.
Torsions / QM Methods: D. Smith suggested that ANI-1 could be a good, fast solution to evaluate energy. It has been decided, though, that for now ANI-1 and semiempirical methods won’t be used for computing torsion scans.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Jan 31, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-31/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-31/</guid><description>Property selection: L.-P. Wang suggested using surface tension for parameter fitting, which isn’t a traditional property used in force field parameterization. A discussion ensued about the merits of using surface tension as one of the target properties, and whether precedents in literature exists. L.-P. Wang described some previous work looking at the simulations of a slab of liquid showing moderate agreement with experiment, and highlighted that, according to the study, the results are relatively consistent as long as the film has no holes.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Jan 24, 2019)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</guid><description>API: This meeting focused on API design aspects of PropertyCalculator, including how to tackle situations in which multiple properties with different convergence rates are computed from the same simulation. These properties could be reported asynchronously, as they are being computed, or they could only be returned upon successful completion of all property calculations. It has been decided to build the API with a possibility to allow asynchronous reporting in the future, although this feature is not expected to be implemented in the near-term future.</description></item><item><title>January 23, 2019 Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/consortium/minutes/2019-01-23-minutes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/consortium/minutes/2019-01-23-minutes/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board met on 23 Jan 2019.

Qiu.</description></item><item><title>January 7-8, 2019 Consortium Workshop</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/consortium/minutes/2019-01-07-minutes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/consortium/minutes/2019-01-07-minutes/</guid><description>Minutes: Attending: All PIs and software scientists; most industry partners, postdocs, and students (including via Zoom); academic and industry community members

The best practice document for calculating properties in general (from a theoretical standpoint); A specific document which contains best practices for computing properties using OFF tools and force fields, i.e. a specific implementation of the practices described in the document 1.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Nov 29, 2018)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2018-11-29/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2018-11-29/</guid><description>Property Calculator: This call focused on the Property Calculator Framework and outlining some basic design concepts and use cases. The shortest term application is benchmarking for force field parameters. Certain design aspects need further discussion, but the initial rough kernel for setting up simulations at chosen properties/parameters should contain simplistic building blocks: smiles → smirnoff parameters → energy minimization → simulation. MBAR/surrogate model levels are yet to be defined, including model specification options.</description></item><item><title>October 29, 2018 Joint Governing/Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/consortium/minutes/2018-10-29-minutes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/consortium/minutes/2018-10-29-minutes/</guid><description>Minutes: Attending: All PIs, both governing board members, and most advisory board members, via Zoom.
Short-term roadmap/minimum viable product: In general folks are supportive of current effort plans. However, there was consensus we need a tool for bespoke parameterization of molecules, especially internal molecules which might not be able to be disclosed to the larger effort, as part of our minimum viable product.
Funding/financials: Currently we have eight partners on board (with openforcefield.</description></item><item><title>Torsion subgroup update</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/2018-10-16-torsions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/2018-10-16-torsions/</guid><description>Participants John Chodera (MSKCC), Jessica Maat (Mobley group), David Mobley (UC Irvine), Levi Naden (MolSSI), Jessica Nash (MolSSI), Yudong Qiu (Wang group), Daniel Smith (MolSSI), Chaya Stern (Chodera group), Jeff Wagner (OpenFF), Lee-Ping Wang (UC Davis)

Madin and R. Messerly presented reversible-jump Monte Carlo (RJMC) performance study focused on L-J parameter space and compared it with numerical integration of probability regions in an analytical surrogate model. These preliminary results show that the two methods are in qualitative agreement, but quantitative discrepancies are suspected to arise due to grid spacing in numerical integration or scaling maps. The main goal of this exercise was to validate RJMC sampling coverage.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Open Force Field Science Updates</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/2018-10-11-chodera/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/science/updates/2018-10-11-chodera/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to introduce Open Force Field Science Updates, a lightweight science blog series in which researchers working with the Open Force Field Initiative will post about their research and engineering directions and scientific progress on various aspects of the Initiative.

MolSSI fellow Caitlin Bannan will talk about the Initiative&amp;rsquo;s overall goals and her work on learned chemical perception. Register through BioExcel, or if you can&amp;rsquo;t make it, video should be available afterwards.
Bannan&amp;rsquo;s Abstract: The Open Force Field Initiative is developing a machinery to automatically parameterize molecular mechanics force fields. An important part of this process will be automating chemical perception — the way force field parameters are assigned to a molecule based on chemical environment.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Open Force Field Consortium</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/news/introducing-the-consortium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.github.io/news/introducing-the-consortium/</guid><description>We’re excited to announce the launch of the Open Force Field Consortium, an academic-industry collaboration designed to improve small molecule force fields used to guide pharmaceutical drug discovery. The Open Force Field Initiative is what we are calling our overall research effort, whereas the Open Force Field Consortium refers specifically to the academic-industry collaboration.

The Open Force Field Initiative is an open effort to build iteratively more accurate force fields to improve predictive design, along with the necessary infrastructure to make these force fields easier to build and use, and to provide a modern platform for powering force field science.</description></item></channel></rss>
