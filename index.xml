Recent highlights have included the release of a series of updates to Parsley, a small molecule force field for biomolecular simulation, which is now at version OpenFF-1.2.0. Parsley was iteratively optimized to improve agreement with quantum chemical geometries, energetics, and vibrational frequencies.
Here, we provide a preliminary benchmark assessment of several small molecule force fields (FF) compared to quantum mechanical (QM) results regarding gas phase energies and geometries of a set of molecule conformers.</description></item><item><title>Lee-Ping Wang stepping down from a leadership role</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/lpw-stepdown/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/lpw-stepdown/</guid><description>From August 1, the Open Force Field Initiative will undergo a change in the leadership team, as Lee-Ping Wang has decided to step down from his role as an OpenFF primary investigator.

Currently, the HCT, OBC1, and OBC2 models (corresponding to AMBER keywords igb=1, 2, and 5, respectively) are supported, with the OBC2 implementation being the most flexible. Unfortunately, systems produced using these keywords are not yet transferable to other simulation packages via ParmEd, so users are restricted to using OpenMM to simulate systems with GBSA.

Open Forcefield Advisory Board Meeting Minutes – March 20, 2019 Status Updates: OFFI NIH proposal submitted and available publicly Hiring update: Karmen Condic-Jurkic starts April 1 as half-time scientific coordinator/project manager Interviews ongoing for bespoke torsion fitting and potentially electrostatics role Open Force Field Toolkit update: Alpha release slated for April 2 Will contain RDKit backend support in abstracted cheminformatics structure (allowing future support for alternative cheminformatics packages to be easily added) Supposed to give same results regardless of RDKit or OpenEye (tested with ~2k molecules from eMolecules to have same energies, forces, and force terms) Differences in aromaticity models could result in some differences in corner cases We are adding a “paranoid mode” so we can detect differences between toolkits that arise when building force fields SDF with standardized tags will be the supported method for importing molecules with custom charges OpenEye and RDKit on-board with standardized tags for charges There may have been minor changes to XML forcefield format since the January preview release Changes are summarized here OFFI hope is to have weekly/biweekly bugfix or feature releases and conda package updates Partners and users are directed to use the Github issue tracker to report issues or problems Technical questions – Desmond support How is Desmond currently used by Partners?</description></item><item><title>Open Force Field Initiative applies for NIH funding</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/seeking-nih-funding/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/seeking-nih-funding/</guid><description>The ultimate goal of the Open Force Field Initiative is to produce modern, high-quality tools for building better force fields, and to apply these tools to produce consistently more accurate generations of biomolecular force fields that are incredibly easy to use in a variety of molecular simulation packages.

Short-term roadmap/minimum viable product: In general folks are supportive of current effort plans. However, there was consensus we need a tool for bespoke parameterization of molecules, especially internal molecules which might not be able to be disclosed to the larger effort, as part of our minimum viable product.
Funding/financials: Currently we have eight partners on board (with openforcefield.</description></item><item><title>October 11, 2018 Governing Board Meeting</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/consortium/minutes/2018-10-11-minutes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/consortium/minutes/2018-10-11-minutes/</guid><description>Agenda: October meeting draft agenda and start time January meeting location Maat hiring Slack Funding processing update/onboarding update Involvement with science meetings (subprojects) and project planning Discuss blog posts?

MolSSI fellow Caitlin Bannan will talk about the Initiative&amp;rsquo;s overall goals and her work on learned chemical perception. Register through BioExcel, or if you can&amp;rsquo;t make it, video should be available afterwards.
Bannan&amp;rsquo;s Abstract: The Open Force Field Initiative is developing a machinery to automatically parameterize molecular mechanics force fields. An important part of this process will be automating chemical perception — the way force field parameters are assigned to a molecule based on chemical environment.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Open Force Field Consortium</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/</guid><description>We’re excited to announce the launch of the Open Force Field Consortium, an academic-industry collaboration designed to improve small molecule force fields used to guide pharmaceutical drug discovery. The Open Force Field Initiative is what we are calling our overall research effort, whereas the Open Force Field Consortium refers specifically to the academic-industry collaboration.
Modeling tools based on force fields assist development of therapies for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease throughout academia and industry.</description></item><item><title>Support for open source cheminformatics toolkits is coming!</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/rdkit-support-is-coming/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/rdkit-support-is-coming/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work with a large-scale infrastructure overhaul of our main openforcefield toolkit following the Open Force Field Toolkit 0.1.0 prerelease, which provided an initial reference implementation of the SMIRNOFF 0.1 specification for direct chemical perception. Many thanks to all the users who provided helpful feedback in how we could improve overall usability!
While we expect the updated toolkit to be released very soon, we wanted to provide a summary of the coming changes to give you an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Open Force Field Initiative</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-initiative/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/news/introducing-the-initiative/</guid><description>Molecular modeling is widely used in diverse pharmaceutical discovery applications, but its utility and predictive power is limited by the accuracy of the underlying molecular mechanics force field used to compute the energetics of biomolecular systems. The Open Force Field Initiative is an open effort to build iteratively more accurate force fields to improve predictive design, along with the necessary infrastructure to make these force fields easier to build and use, and to provide a modern platform for powering force field science.</description></item><item><title>Hit-to-Lead</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/hit-to-lead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/hit-to-lead/</guid><description>Program 1 Program 2</description></item><item><title>Lead Optimization</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/lead-optimization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/lead-optimization/</guid><description>Program 1 Program 2</description></item><item><title>Investigational New Drug (IND) filings</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/investigational-new-drugs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/investigational-new-drugs/</guid><description>Program 1 Program 2</description></item><item><title/><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/img/icons/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/img/icons/readme/</guid><description>Icons from The Noun Project Icons are CC-BY from The Noun Project
