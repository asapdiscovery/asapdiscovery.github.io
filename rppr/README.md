Dear John, Theresa, and Maggie

NIH has identified issues with the submission of Multi-Year Funded Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPRs) using the eRA Commons, consequently all AViDD awardees must now use the PHS 2590 format instead of the eRA Commons to prepare and submit the Annual Progress Report for Year 1.   Please disregard the instructions previously transmitted via the email sent in November 2022. 

Please see the attached instructions for the PHS 2590 format and the Revised AViDD Progress Report Guidelines.  The additional information being requested in the Revised AViDD Progress Report Guidelines is the same as the previous version, however, for the PHS 2590 format you will now provide this information using Form page 5 instead of sections noted in the previous version.

The PHS 2590 forms can be downloaded from: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/2590/2590.htm

The Annual Progress Report will contain separate reports for each component of your AViDD.   You will create a separate PHS 2590 report for the AViDD Overall progress, each Research Project, and each Core, and these will be combined to generate the Annual Progress Report.

The separate reports for each component will contain:
* Form Page 1:  Face Page – leave Items 8a and 8b blank
    * Form Page 1-continued:  Additional form if Multiple PIs are involved
* Project/Performance Site Format Page - use only if additional space is needed
* Biographical Sketch: Complete a Biographical Sketch for all new senior/key personnel since the previous submission.  Use form available from https://grants.nih.gov/grants/forms/biosketch.htm
* Other Support: Include other active support for all senior/key personnel whose support has changed during the past year and indicate what the change has occurred.  Use form available from https://grants.nih.gov/grants/forms/othersupport.htm
* Form Page 5:  Progress Report Summary - this form will be used to provide both the additional information required for AViDD awards as well as the standard information required for a Progress Report.  Please refer to the Revised AViDD Progress Report Guidelines for the additional information required to be included in the Progress Summary for the AViDD Overall, Research Project and Core reports.
    * Use the Continuation page after Form page 5 is full for this section and any other sections that require additional pages after the initial form.
* Form Page 6:  Checklist
* Form Page 7:  All Personnel Report
* If Human Subjects Research is being conducted - include the PHS Inclusion Enrollment Report

Please refer to the attached Revised AViDD Progress Report Guidelines and the phs2590 General Instructions found on pages 5 through 17 for guidance about the information required for each section.

Because your AViDD award is a Multi-Year Funded award you are not required to submit Detailed Budget for Next Budget Period or Budget Justification pages as part of the Annual Progress Report.  In addition, carry forward requests are not required during the remaining time of the Multi-Year Funded project period.   However, if the situation arises, please note, prior approval is still required for compliance with the significant rebudgeting policy as stated in the NIH Grants Policy Statement https://grants.nih.gov/policy/nihgps/index.htm:

Significant rebudgeting, whether or not the particular expenditure(s) require prior approval:  Significant rebudgeting occurs when expenditures in a single direct cost budget category deviate (increase or decrease) from the categorical commitment level established for the budget period by 25 percent or more of the total direct costs awarded. For example, if the award budget for total direct costs is $200,000, any rebudgeting that would result in an increase or decrease of more than $50,000 in a budget category is considered significant rebudgeting

To submit the report, your Authorized Institutional Official will email the entire Annual Progress Report to Bianca Steele, who is the NIAID Grants Management Official for this award, and me.

These reports are due by the project anniversary date (05/16/2023) for your award and can be submitted anytime between now and then.  
As noted above, please read through the Revised AViDD Report Guidelines and the PHS 2590 instructions.  If questions remain, then please have your business official contact Bianca Steele and me.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Sincerely yours,

Maureen
