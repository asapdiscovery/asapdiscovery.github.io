All ASAP TPPs are draft TPPs intended to help guide the development of target candidate profiles (TCPs) for antiviral discovery within the ASAP Discovery Consortium. ASAP works with stakeholders around the globe (such as the World Health Organization) to align TPPs to ensure they meet the needs of communities and fulfill our mission of global, equitable, and affordable access to antiviral therapies.</description></item><item><title>Target Enabling Packages (TEPs)</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/target-enabling-packages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/target-enabling-packages/</guid><description>A Target Enabling Package (TEP) is a complete data package needed to enable structure-based drug discovery against an antiviral target. Pioneered by the Structural Genomics Consortium, each TEP contains relevant protein constructs and plasmid resources for one or more viral family members, protein expression and purification protocols, crystallization conditions, structures from an X-ray fragment screen at the Diamond Light Source XChem facility, small molecule hits, and biochemical assay protocols with at least one validated inhibitor with quantifiable activity.</description></item><item><title>Assay Cascades</title><link>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/assay-cascades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asapdiscovery.org/outputs/assay-cascades/</guid><description>An assay cascade is a defined set of assays and progression criteria used by a drug discovery program to achieve its Target Candidate Profile (TCP) goals in a time- and cost-effective manner.
