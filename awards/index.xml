To begin to address this challenge, the ASAP team is using a structure-based approach to identify druggable regions of enzymes and structural proteins from positive-strand RNA viruses. Thus, the ASAP virology team needs efficient mutational methods to explore sequence variation within viral genomes, allowing them to: 1) validate druggable targets, including protein domains that lack known enzymatic activities; and 2) identify potential mechanisms of, and hopefully ameliorate, resistance to ASAP-developed antiviral compounds.</description></item></channel></rss>
