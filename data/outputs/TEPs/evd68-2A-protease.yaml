  summary: >
    The conserved 2A protease of enterovirus D68 is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein.
    This TEP aims to provide early tools for structure-based discovery of 3C protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.

  scientific_background: >
    While enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild or severe, it can also cause acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a serious neurological condition which mostly affects children that causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak (via CDC).

  # This is a summary of the work we have done on the Enterovirus A71 3C protease to date.
