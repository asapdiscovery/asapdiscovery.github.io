  # Summary of Project

  summary: >
    The coronavirus family poses a major global health concern.  Notably, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as COVID-19 cause severe illness in mammals and birds. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to identify novel therapeutic interventions and strategies of pandemic preparedness. 
    MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that was first discovered in 2012 [1](https://doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1211721). The disease has spread rapidly with large outbreaks as recent as 2015 and 2018 [2](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)), [3](https:)//doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60454-8), [4](https://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/mers-cov/mers-outbreaks.html), [5](https://doi: 10.1128/genomeA.00818-15). Currently there is no therapeutic intervention for MERS-CoV with 35% of reported cases resulting in human death [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26049252/)]. Like-wise to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV produces a main protease (Mpro) which is essential for viral replication and therefore an attractive target to stop the virus [7](https://doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.651463), [8](https://doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2015.05.018), [9](https://doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2015.02.025). This TEP includes the protocols used for producing recombinant MERS-CoV Mpro, assay documentation as well as crystallization protocols. Moreover, it contains information about different enzymatic and viral replication assays for orthogonal validation of small molecule inhibitors in order determine structure-activity relationships. All data are fully open and constitute a unique resource, not only for this target, but for improving methodology of fragment-to-hit and hit-to-lead progression.
  # Scientific Background:
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  scientific_background: >
    The emergence of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic of unexpected scale. The disease is caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus [10](https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS1473-3099(20)30144-4), [11](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3), [12](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2001017) and has so far claimed more than [7 million lives world-wide](November 2020, https://covid19.who.int), despite numerous regional lockdowns in order to stop the spread of the virus. However, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is already the third zoonotic coronavirus outbreak after the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23078800/), [14](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13967-0), [15](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1211721), there is a notable lack of antiviral treatment options. SARS-CoV-2 is a large enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA Betacoronavirus from the order of nidoviruses. Its RNA encodes two open reading frames that, through ribosome frame-shifting, generates two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab [16](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fnar%2F18.7.1825). The genome contains a large replicase gene encompassing nonstructural proteins (Nsps), followed by structural and accessory genes. The polyproteins are processed by two viral cysteine proteases: a papain-like protease (PLpro) which cleaves three sites, releasing non-structural proteins nsp1-3 and a 3C-like protease, also referred to as the main protease (Mpro), that cleaves at 11 sites to release non-structural proteins (nsp4-16). These non-structural proteins form the replicase complex responsible for replication and transcription of the viral genome and have led to Mpro and PLPro being the primary targets for antiviral drug development [17](https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12936).

  conclusion: >
    This TEP provides a comprehensive sampling of the binding properties of the active site of SARS-CoV-2
    main protease by small molecule fragment molecules. Together with the established enzymatic assays, it
    forms the bases for rational, structure-based drug development. The usefulness of the data and protocols
    presented in this TEP have been demonstrated by the [COVID Moonshot consortium](https://covid.postera.ai/covid) successfully
    developing sub-micromolar binders, that are now in lead optimisation.

      # Brief description of the plasmid
      description:  Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 for heterologous protein expression in Escherichia coli.
            The protein was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography, followed by HRV 3C protease treatment which
            yielded native N- and C-termini. HRV 3C protease was removed by reverse Ni-affinity chromatography,
            followed by a gel filtration step. The purified protein appears as a dimer in size-exclusion chromatography.

      description:  We performed an exhaustive crystallographic fragment screen to probe the Mpro active site, and to identify
                    opportunities for fragment merging or growing. Additionally, a library of mild electrophilic fragments was
                    screened by mass spectrometry for probing the binding properties around the active site cysteine. Overall,
                    a total of 1742 soaking and 1139 co-crystallization experiments resulted in 1877 mounted crystals. This
                    resulted in determination of 91 protein-fragment structures.

        Data were collected at the beamline I04-1 at 100 K and processed with the fully automated pipelines at
        Diamond Light Source [[11](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2011.06.010)], which variously combine XDS [[12](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444909047374)], xia2 [[13](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444913015308)], autoPROC [[14](https://doi.org/10.1107/S0907444911007773)] and DIALS [[15](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798317017235)], and select resolution limits algorithmically; no manual curation of processing parameters was applied. Further
        analysis was performed through XChemExplorer [[16](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798316020234)]: for each dataset, the version of processed data was
        selected by the default XChemExplorer score, and electron density maps were generated with Dimple.
        Ligand-binding events were identified using PanDDA [[18](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15123)] (both the released version 0.2 and a pre-release
        development version (https://github.com/ConorFWild/pandda), and ligands were modelled into PanDDAcalculated
        event maps using Coot [[19](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444910007493)]. Restraints were calculated with ACEDRG [[20](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798317000067)] or GRADE, structures were refined with Refmac [[22](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444911001314)] and Buster.
        Fragments were soaked into crystals by adding dissolved compound directly to the crystallisation drops. The
        following libraries were screened: the DSipoised library (Enamine), a version of the poised library [[24](https://doi.org/10.1039/C5SC03115J)]; a
        version of the MiniFrags library [[25](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2019.03.009)] assembled in-house; the FragLites library; a library of shape-diverse
        3D fragments (“York3D”) [[27](https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202001123)]; heterocyclic electrophiles [[28](http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c8md00327k)]; and the SpotFinder library. All fragments were    
        in 100% DMSO at varying stock concentrations, detailed at https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/
        Fragment-Screening/Fragment-Libraries.html). In brief, 55 nl of fragment stock solutions in DMSO (DSIpoised,
        FragLite, PepLites, York 3D, Covalent Heterocylces and SpotFinder all at 500 mM, MiniFrags at 1 M
        and Cysteine covalent library at 20 mM) were transferred directly to 500 nl crystallisation drops using an
        ECHO liquid handler giving a final compound concentration of 2–100 mM and DMSO concentration of 10%.
        Drops were incubated at room temperature for ~1 h prior to mounting and flash cooling in liquid nitrogen
        without the addition of further cryoprotectant.

        Assays are performed in Greiner 384 low volume plates into which the compounds are dispensed using an
        Echo 555 acoustic dispenser keeping the DMSO concentration < 1%. A 15 μM enzyme stock solution is
        prepared in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 300 mM NaCl, and subsequently diluted to a working solution of 300
        nM Mpro in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 50 mM NaCl). Mpro is pre-incubated for 15 minutes at
        room temperature with the inhibitor compounds before the addition of substrate to initiate the reaction. The
        final reaction concentrations are 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 150 nM Mpro and 2 μM substrate
        (TSAVLQSGFRK-NH2) in 50 μL. The reaction is incubated for 10 min at room temperature before quenching
        with 10% formic acid. The reactions are analysed with MS using RapidFire (RF) 365 high-throughput
        sampling robot (Agilent) connected to an iFunnel Agilent 6550 accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF)
        mass spectrometer using electrospray. RapidFire integrator software (Agilent) was used to extract the
        m/z (+1) charge states of both the substrate (1191.67 Da) and cleaved N-terminal product TSAVLQ (617.34
        Da) from the total ion chromatogram data which is used to calculate the percentage inhibition. All data is
        directly uploaded to the Moonshot vault for data analysis. The readouts are converted to % inhibition and
        the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is used to fit a Hill equation to dose-response data constrained with
        minimum value = 0.0 and maximum value = 100 to calculate IC~50~ values.

      id: MERS-Mpro-protease_biochemical-assay
      description: |
        This method is intended to measure the activity of viral proteases by using a specific labelled-peptide that allows the detection of the cleaved product. The substrate contains the cleavage-sequence specific to the tested protease and is labeled in C-terminal by the fluorophore Edans (ex 336 nm; em: 455 nm) and in N-ternimal by the quencher Dabcyl (ex 472 nm). In the case of a non-cleaved substrate, the proximity of Dabcyl to Edans prevents the emission and the detection of the fluorescence at 455 nm. The cleavage of the peptide by the protease allows Edans’ fluorescence emission and detection.

        Plate reader: Pherastar FS, BMG Labtech (Germany), 350-460 FI optic module, the plate is read every 30 s for 2 hours and shacked during 5 s before the first reading.
        Method: Fifty µL of 2x protein solution were added to each well containing the compounds to be tested previously dispensed onto the plate. The mix has been incubated for one hour at room temperature and the enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 µL of 2x (40 µM) substrate solution using the plate reader injector. The fluorescence intensity at 460 nm was read every 30 seconds for 2 hours in kinetic mode, which include a shaking step of the plate between each measurement.
        The IC50 was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against various concentrations of tested inhibitor by using a four parameter dose−response curve in Prism (v8.0) software.
