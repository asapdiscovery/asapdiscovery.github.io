  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: >
    The coronavirus family poses a major global health concern.  Notably, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as COVID-19 cause severe illness in mammals and birds. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to identify novel therapeutic interventions and strategies of pandemic preparedness. 
    MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that was first discovered in 2012 [9](https://doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1211721)]. The disease has spread rapidly with large outbreaks as recent as 2015 and 2018 [[10](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)), [11](https:)//doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60454-8), [12](https://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/mers-cov/mers-outbreaks.html), [13](https://doi: 10.1128/genomeA.00818-15]. Currently there is no therapeutic intervention for MERS-CoV with 35% of reported cases resulting in human death [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26049252/)]. Like-wise to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV produces a main protease (Mpro) which is essential for viral replication and therefore an attractive target to stop the virus [[14](https://doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.651463), [15](https://doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2015.05.018), [16](https://doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2015.02.025)]. This TEP includes the protocols used for producing recombinant MERS-CoV Mpro (comer-NSP5-mpro), assay documentation as well as crystallization protocols. Moreover, it contains information about different enzymatic and viral replication assays for orthogonal validation of small molecule inhibitors in order determine structure-activity relationships. All data are fully open and constitute a unique resource, not only for this target, but for improving methodology of fragment-to-hit and hit-to-lead progression.
  # Scientific Background:

  scientific_background: >
    The emergence of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic of unexpected scale. The disease is caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS1473-3099(20)30144-4), [2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3), [3](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2001017)] for which no approved drugs exist or are in the pipeline. This disease has so far claimed more than 1.2 million lives world-wide (November 2020, https://covid19.who.int), despite numerous regional lockdowns in order to stop the spread of the virus. However, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is already the third zoonotic coronavirus outbreak after the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23078800/), [5](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13967-0), [6](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1211721)], there is a notable lack of antiviral treatment options. SARS-CoV-2 is a large enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA Betacoronavirus from the order of nidoviruses. Its RNA encodes two open reading frames that, through ribosome frame-shifting, generates two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab [[7](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fnar%2F18.7.1825)]. The genome contains a large replicase gene encompassing nonstructural proteins (Nsps), followed by structural and accessory genes. The polyproteins are processed by two viral cysteine proteases: a papain-like protease (PLpro) which cleaves three sites, releasing non-structural proteins nsp1-3 and a 3C-like protease, also referred to as the main protease (Mpro), that cleaves at 11 sites to release non-structural proteins (nsp4-16). These non-structural proteins form the replicase complex responsible for replication and transcription of the viral genome and have led to Mpro and PLPro being the primary targets for antiviral drug development [[8](https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12936)].

  conclusion: >
    This TEP provides a comprehensive sampling of the binding properties of the active site of SARS-CoV-2
    main protease by small molecule fragment molecules. Together with the established enzymatic assays, it
    forms the bases for rational, structure-based drug development. The usefulness of the data and protocols
    presented in this TEP have been demonstrated by the [COVID Moonshot consortium](https://covid.postera.ai/covid) successfully
    developing sub-micromolar binders, that are now in lead optimisation.

        The expression clone of Mpro (Accession: YP_009725301, Protein Region: S1-Q306) consists of a synthetic
        gene in pGEX-6P-1 expression plasmid containing N-terminal GST and C-terminal 3C PROTEASE and 6xHIS
        tags. After transformation into BL21(DE3)-R3-pRARE2, expression was performed in Auto Induction Medium
        supplemented with glycerol and 100 μg/ml Carbenicillin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 5 h
        before switching to 18 °C, 200 rpm for a further 10 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored
        at -80 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM
        Imidazole and 0.03 μg/ml Benzonase before disrupting with a highpressure homogeniser (3 passes, 30 kpsi, 4
        °C). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g and the supernatant applied to a Nickel-NTA
        gravity column and washed with buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl and 25 mM imidazole pH
        8. The protein was eluted using a gradient of 25–500 mM imidazole. N-terminal His-tagged HRV 3 C Protease
        was added to the eluted protein at 1:10 w/w ratio. The mixture was dialysed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mM
        Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, after which the HRV 3 C protease and other impurities were removed
        from the cleaved target protein by reverse Nickel-NTA. The relevant fractions were concentrated and applied
        to an S200 16/60 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl buffer. The protein
        was concentrated to 30 mg/ml using a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter device.

      description:  We performed an exhaustive crystallographic fragment screen to probe the Mpro active site, and to identify
                    opportunities for fragment merging or growing. Additionally, a library of mild electrophilic fragments was
                    screened by mass spectrometry for probing the binding properties around the active site cysteine. Overall,
                    a total of 1742 soaking and 1139 co-crystallization experiments resulted in 1877 mounted crystals. This
                    resulted in determination of 91 protein-fragment structures.

        **Initial Crystallization and Structure determination of MERS-CoV Mpro**<br>

        MERS Mpro (comer-NSP5-mpro) crystals formed in SWISSCi 3-drop sitting drop plates. Needle like crystals form in a broad range of optimization conditions that centre around crystallization solution 1: 0.2M Sodium malonate dibasic monohydrate, 0.1M Bis-Tris propane pH 7.5, 20% w/v PEG 3350 as well as solution 2: 0.2M Sodium malonate dibasic monohydrate, 20% w/v PEG 3350. The addition of seed dramatically improved consistency of crystals (number of crystals formed per plate, as well as resolution). Seeding was performed by taking ~20 crystals from a single drop formed from solution 1 or solution 2 crystallization solution respectively. This crystal solution was transferred to 35 μl of crystallization well solution 1 or 2 respectively. Two seed beads were added, the mixture was sonicated for 30 seconds. This was repeated 3 times. A series of seed stock dilutions were prepared ranging from 1:10 – 1:10000. Optimum seed stock used was 1:10 and 1:1000. Crystal plates were setup using protein at 17 mg/ml (base buffer 50mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). Optimum drop volumes used were 300 nl drops (0.5:1 and 1:1 ratio protein to crystallization well solution) with 20 nl seeds. Crystallization well solution volume used was 35 μl. Crystals tolerate up to 30% DMSO for 2 hours. Compound soaking conditions were 30% DMSO, for 1 hour using crystal that formed from crystallization solution 1.

        ** Data collection**

        Data were collected to 1.78Å resolution at Diamond light source beamline I04-1. 

        **Data processing**
        The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of MERS coronavirus main protease in space group C2221 (5C3N) as a search model. Crystal packing belonged to space group C2221 with two Mpro molecules in ASU.

        **Initial Crystallization and Structure determination of SARS-CoV2 Mpro**<br>

        Protein was thawed and diluted to 5 mg/ml using 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl. The sample was
        centrifuged at 100 000 g for 15 minutes to remove aggregates. MPRO crystals were obtained by mixing 150nL
        of protein in with 300 nL of reservoir solution containing 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 15% PEG6K, 5% DMSO and 50nL
        seed stock. Crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C and appeared within
        24 hours.

        **Crystallographic fragment screening agains SARS-CoV2 Mpro**<br>

        Data were collected at the beamline I04-1 at 100 K and processed with the fully automated pipelines at
        Diamond Light Source [[11](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2011.06.010)], which variously combine XDS [[12](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444909047374)], xia2 [[13](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444913015308)], autoPROC [[14](https://journals.iucr.org/https://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0907444911007773)] and DIALS [[15](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798317017235)], and
        select resolution limits algorithmically; no manual curation of processing parameters was applied. Further
        analysis was performed through XChemExplorer [[16](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798316020234)]: for each dataset, the version of processed data was
        selected by the default XChemExplorer score, and electron density maps were generated with Dimple.
        Ligand-binding events were identified using PanDDA [[18](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15123)] (both the released version 0.2 and a pre-release
        development version (https://github.com/ConorFWild/pandda), and ligands were modelled into PanDDAcalculated
        event maps using Coot [[19](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444910007493)]. Restraints were calculated with ACEDRG [[20](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798317000067)] or GRADE,
        structures were refined with Refmac [[22](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444911001314)] and Buster.
            
        Fragments were soaked into crystals by adding dissolved compound directly to the crystallisation drops. The
        following libraries were screened: the DSipoised library (Enamine), a version of the poised library [[24](https://doi.org/10.1039/C5SC03115J)]; a
        version of the MiniFrags library [[25](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2019.03.009)] assembled in-house; the FragLites library; a library of shape-diverse
        3D fragments (“York3D”) [[27](https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202001123)]; heterocyclic electrophiles [[28](http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c8md00327k)]; and the SpotFinder library. All fragments were    
        in 100% DMSO at varying stock concentrations, detailed at https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/
        Fragment-Screening/Fragment-Libraries.html). In brief, 55 nl of fragment stock solutions in DMSO (DSIpoised,
        FragLite, PepLites, York 3D, Covalent Heterocylces and SpotFinder all at 500 mM, MiniFrags at 1 M
        and Cysteine covalent library at 20 mM) were transferred directly to 500 nl crystallisation drops using an
        ECHO liquid handler giving a final compound concentration of 2–100 mM and DMSO concentration of 10%.
        Drops were incubated at room temperature for ~1 h prior to mounting and flash cooling in liquid nitrogen
        without the addition of further cryoprotectant.

        **FRET-based proteolytic assay**<br>
        Assays are performed in Greiner 384 low volume plates into which the compounds are dispensed using an
        Echo 555 acoustic dispenser keeping the DMSO concentration < 1%. Mpro is pre-incubated for 15 minutes at
        room temperature with the inhibitor compounds before the substrate is added to initiate the reaction.
        Protease reaction was measured continuously in a BMG Pherastar FS with a 480/520 ex/em filter set. The
        final reaction concentrations are 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 1 mM TCEP, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20, 10%
        glycerol, 5 nM Mpro, 375 nM fluorogenic peptide substrate ([5-FAM]-AVLQSGFR-[Lys(Dabcyl)]-K-amide) in 20
        μL. All data is directly uploaded to the Moonshot vault on the Collaborative Drug Discovery Inc. (CDD)
        website for data analysis. The readouts are converted to % inhibition and the Levenberg–Marquardt
        algorithm is used to fit a Hill equation to dose-response data constrained with minimum value = 0.0 and
        maximum value = 100 to calculate IC50 values.

        **RapidFire Mass Spectrometry assay**<br>
        Assays are performed in Greiner 384 low volume plates into which the compounds are dispensed using an
        Echo 555 acoustic dispenser keeping the DMSO concentration < 1%. A 15 μM enzyme stock solution is
        prepared in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 300 mM NaCl, and subsequently diluted to a working solution of 300
        nM Mpro in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 50 mM NaCl). Mpro is pre-incubated for 15 minutes at
        room temperature with the inhibitor compounds before the addition of substrate to initiate the reaction. The
        final reaction concentrations are 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 150 nM Mpro and 2 μM substrate
        (TSAVLQSGFRK-NH2) in 50 μL. The reaction is incubated for 10 min at room temperature before quenching
        with 10% formic acid. The reactions are analysed with MS using RapidFire (RF) 365 high-throughput
        sampling robot (Agilent) connected to an iFunnel Agilent 6550 accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF)
        mass spectrometer using electrospray. RapidFire integrator software (Agilent) was used to extract the
        m/z (+1) charge states of both the substrate (1191.67 Da) and cleaved N-terminal product TSAVLQ (617.34
        Da) from the total ion chromatogram data which is used to calculate the percentage inhibition. All data is
        directly uploaded to the Moonshot vault for data analysis. The readouts are converted to % inhibition and
        the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is used to fit a Hill equation to dose-response data constrained with
        minimum value = 0.0 and maximum value = 100 to calculate IC50 values.
