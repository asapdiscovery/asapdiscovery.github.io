  summary: >
    This TEP provides early tools for structure-based discovery of enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 3C protease inhibitors, including protocols of recombinant protein production, biochemical assays and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening. Full details of this TEP are available in [this living online sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19p8vFSxPMPO-UpMJGwh1sGpsHn5kYxMooJ5ucJmXRHQ/edit?gid=2111537661#gid=2111537661).
  # Scientific Background
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  scientific_background: >
    While enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild or severe, it can also cause [acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)](https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/index.html), a serious neurological condition which mostly affects children that causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak (via [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html)).
    Enterovirus 3C protease is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein and various host proteins to facilitate viral infection; thus, inhibition can reinstate the antiviral functions of some of these targets.
    The protease has a typical chymotrypsin fold with a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad.

        The construct was transformed into the *E. coli* strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells were grown at 37°C in TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 1, , the temperature was lowered to 18°C. After 1 hour 0.5 mM D-biotin was added and then after a further 1 hour induction of protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG and growth continued overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1% TX-100, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 mg/mL benzonase]. Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) the column was washed with binding buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Protein was lastly purified by SEC (Superose 12 pg,Cytiva) in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis andd mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required. For protein crystallization protein was exchanged into a buffer of 10 mM Bicine pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % Glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP to allow a higher final protein concentration.

    - name: EV-A71 3C protease activity biochemical assay using fluorescence intensity measurements
      id: eva71-3C-protease_biochemical-assay
      description: This method is intended to measure the activity of viral proteases by using a specific labeled peptide that allows the detection of the cleaved product. The substrate contains the cleavage-sequence specific to the tested protease and is labeled in C-terminal by the fluorophore Edans (abs 336 nm; em 490 nm) and in N-terminal by the quencher Dabcyl (abs 472 nm). In the case of a non-cleaved substrate, the proximity of Dabcyl to Edans prevents the emission and the detection of the fluorescence at 490 nm. The cleavage of the peptide by the protease allows Edans’ fluorescence emission and detection.
