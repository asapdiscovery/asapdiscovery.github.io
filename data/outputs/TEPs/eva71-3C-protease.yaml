  summary: >
    The conserved 3C protease of enterovirus A71 is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein.
    This TEP aims to provide early tools for structure-based discovery of 3C protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.
  # Scientific Background

  scientific_background: >
    While enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild or severe, it can also cause [acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)](https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/index.html), a serious neurological condition which mostly affects children that causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak (via [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html)).
    Enterovirus 3C protease is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein. 
    3C also cleaves many host proteins to facilitate viral infection; thus, inhibition can reinstate the antiviral functions of some of these targets.
    The protease has a typical chymotrypsin fold with a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad.

        The construct was transformed into the *E. coli* strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells were grown at 37°C in TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 1, the temperature was lowered to 18°C before induction of protein expression overnight by adding 0.5 mM IPTG. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1% TX-100, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 mg/mL benzonase]. Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) the column was washed with binding buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Protein was lastly purified by SEC (Superose 12 pg,Cytiva) in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis andd mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required. For protein crystallization protein was exchanged into a buffer of 10 mM Bicine pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % Glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP to allow a higher final protein concentration.

    - name: EV-A71 3C protease activity biochemical assay using fluorescence intensity measurements
      id: eva71-3C-protease_biochemical-assay
      description: This method is intended to measure the activity of viral proteases by using a specific labeled peptide that allows the detection of the cleaved product. The substrate contains the cleavage-sequence specific to the tested protease and is labeled in C-terminal by the fluorophore Edans (abs 336 nm; em 490 nm) and in N-ternimal by the quencher Dabcyl (abs 472 nm). In the case of a non-cleaved substrate, the proximity of Dabcyl to Edans prevents the emission and the detection of the fluorescence at 490 nm. The cleavage of the peptide by the protease allows Edans’ fluorescence emission and detection.

        Plates: ProxiPlate-384 Plus, white, Greiner cat# 6008280.
        Liquid handler: Echo® acoustic liquid handler (Beckman Coulter, USA)
        Plate reader: Pherastar FS, BMG Labtech (Germany), 350-490 FI optic module, the plate is read every 30 s for 2 hours and shacked during 5 s before the first reading.
        Protocol EV-A71 3C Pro: Ten µL of 2x protein solution were added to each well containing the compounds to be tested previously dispensed onto the plate and incubate with the enzyme for one hour at room temperature. Enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 µL of 2x (40 µM) substrate solution using the plate reader injector. The fluorescence intensity at 490 nm was read every 30 seconds for 2 hours in kinetic mode.The IC50 was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against various concentrations of tested inhibitor by using a four parameter dose−response curve in Prism (v8.0) software.

        Imaging Schedule: first images after 12hrs and then following a Fibonacci sequence of days for further image collections. Crystal typically form after ~24hrs, after which they have reached the maximum size typically however precipitant often remains. Crystals typically form on their own. Crystals are sturdy and can be manipulated in solution readily.
        Morphology: typically thin rectangles with pointed ends.
        Size: ~50um in length and ~25um in width, depth of the crystals is ~5um, giving a glass shard appearance:
