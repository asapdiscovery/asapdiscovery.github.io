  summary: >
    The conserved 3C protease of enterovirus A71 is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein.
    This TEP aims to provide early tools for structure-based discovery of 3C protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.

  scientific_background: >
    While enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild or severe, it can also cause [acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)](https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/index.html), a serious neurological condition which mostly affects children that causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak (via [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html)).
    Enterovirus 3C protease is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein. 
    3C also cleaves many host proteins to facilitate viral infection; thus, inhibition can reinstate the antiviral functions of some of these targets.
    The protease has a typical chymotrypsin fold with a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad.
