  summary: >
    The conserved 3C protease of enterovirus A71 is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein.
    This TEP aims to provide early tools for structure-based discovery of 3C protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.

  scientific_background: >
    While enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild or severe, it can also cause [acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)](https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/index.html), a serious neurological condition which mostly affects children that causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak (via [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html)).
    Enterovirus 3C protease is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein. 
    3C also cleaves many host proteins to facilitate viral infection; thus, inhibition can reinstate the antiviral functions of some of these targets.
    The protease has a typical chymotrypsin fold with a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad.

        Plate format: SwissCI 3 lens

        Screen: 0.1M Tris (pH 8.50), 0.2M Magnesium Cloride Hexahydrate, 30% w/v PEG 4000

        Reservoir volume: 30 μl

        Protein needed: 43.2ul per full plate

        Drop ratio:  1:1

        EVA71: 150nl

        Final volume: 300 nl

        Incubation temperature: 20°C in Formulatrix

        Imaging Schedule: first images after 12hrs and then following a Fibonacci sequence of days for further image collections. Crystal typically form after ~24hrs, after which they have reached the maximum size typically however precipitant often remains. Crystals typically form on their own. Crystals are sturdy and can be manipulated in solution readily.
        
        Morphology: typically thin rectangles with pointed ends.
        
        Size: ~50um in length and ~25um in width, depth of the crystals is ~5um, giving a glass shard appearance:
