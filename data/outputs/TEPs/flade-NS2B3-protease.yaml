        protocol: |
          * Thaw enzymes on ice and centrifuged 5 min, 4 C, 15000 rpm.
          * Prepare 0.2 µM of 2X enzyme in volume of 10 µl per well.
          * Prepare 10 µM of 2X substrate in volume of 10 µl per well.
          * Dispense 10 µl buffer to positive control wells (wells 1,23 - no enzyme, no compound). 
          * Dispense 10 µl enzyme to wells 2-22,24 (wells 2,24 negative control: enzyme + substrate, no compound)
          * Briefly spin down plate and incubate for 2 hours in RT.
          * Dispense 10 µl substrate to full plate.
          * Briefly spin down plate and incubate for 30 min in RT.
          * Read in Pherastar plate reader (BMG) in Ex: 360nm, Em: 470nm, Gain 300.

          Enzyme: DV2-NS2BgsgNS3

          Substrate:
          * Bz-Nle-Lys-Lys-Arg-AMC
          * CAS # 863975-32-0
          * Cayman (#27710)
          * 5 mg dissolved in 600 µL of DMSO and aliquoted to 50 ul --> stored at -80C as 10mM
          
          Buffer: Enzymes storage buffer 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP.
          
          Assay Buffer (final conc. In plate):
          * 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3
          * 50 mM NaCl
          * 5 % glycerol
          * 1 mM TCEP
          * 0.05 % Igepal
          
          Glycerol, Igepal and TCEP are added to the assay buffer before each run.

          Design:
          * 10 µL of 10 µM substrate + 10 µL of 0.2 µM enzyme in assay buffer 
          * (final assay volume: 20 µl). 
          * Inhibitor compounds were pre-dispensed (from DMSO stock) in duplicates to 384 small volume, black plate (Greiner-784076) and stored in -20 until use (control wells - DMSO only, no compounds). 
          * Dispensing performed using the GNF dispenser
