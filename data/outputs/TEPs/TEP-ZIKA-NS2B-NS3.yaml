  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: >
    The conserved helicase encoded by the C-terminal portion of the non-structural protein 3 (NS3hel) in flaviviruses is employed by the Zika virus (ZIKV) to unwind double stranded RNA during the replication process. This TEP provides early tools to develop NS3hel inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.

  scientific_background: >
    The Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a global public health threat since it was related to major neurological disorders in both infants and adults [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31450-2), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6)]. 
    ZIKV NS3 helicase (NS3hel) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in double-stranded RNA unwind and formation of viral replication machinery, being therefore critical for viral replication [[3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.03.011)]. 
    NS3hel is composed by three domains, with motifs typically associated to RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis [[4](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.3258)]. 
    Both these activities seem to be essential for viral replication [[5](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz650)]. 
    Moreover, drug candidates targeting NS3hel interactions with other viral proteins, such as non-structural protein 4B, was proved to be an effective way of blocking all Dengue serotypes, leading to two clinical candidates [[6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03990-6), [7](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abb2)]. 
    In this way, ZIKV NS3hel is an attractive drug target for the development of antivirals.

  conclusion: >
    Here we have established a purification protocol for recombinant NS3 helicase from Zika viruses and established a robust crystallisation suitable for fragment screening. We have performed a substantial fragment screening campaign and identified many hits.

      description:  This protein yielded highly reproducible crystals upon microseeding, which typically diffracted to 1.5 Å resolution. This crystal system was DMSO tolerant and therefore suitable for our subsequent fragment soaking.

        For expression of protein used for crystallisation, the construct was transformed into the E. coli Rosetta 2 strain BL21(DE3), and cells were grown at 37°C in ZYM5052 medium for auto-induction supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 to 0.6, the temperature was lowered to 18°C before induction of protein expression overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris  (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 40 mM imidazole] and stored at -20°C until purification. For protein purification, pellets were gently thawed in ice and added 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme, 2 mM DTT, 2 µM PMSF, 50 U benzonase, followed by 30min incubation on ice. Lysis was conducted by sonication for 10 min, 45s pulse ON, 60s pulse OFF, 40% amplitude. Lysate was centrifuged for 30min at 15,000g at 4oC for clarification. Proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using HiTrap HP 5.0mL Ni-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. Then protein was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A, than with 10% Buffer B [50 mM Tris  (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole], followed by elution with 15 mL of 100% Buffer B. Removal of the His6 tag was carried out by addition of recombinant 2 mg of TEV protease and 4 mM DTT during overnight dialysis into 2L of buffer A, followed by purification on a second IMAC column, and lastly by SEC (Superdex 75 16/60, GE Healthcare) in a buffer consisting of 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Bis-Tris, 10 % Glycerol, pH 7.0. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then concentrated to 5 mg/mL and flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until required.

        ZIKV NS3hel was concentrated to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and apo crystals were grown in crystallisation solution containing 0.12 M NPS Mix (0.3 M Sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, 0.3 M Ammonium sulphate and 0.3 M Sodium nitrate - Molecular Dimensions), 0.1 M MES/Imidazole pH 6.5 (Molecular Dimensions) and 33% Precipitant Mix 4 (11% MPD, 11% PEG 1,000 e 11% PEG 3,350 – Sigma Aldrich). Fragments were soaked into crystals as previously described by adding dissolved compounds directly to the crystallisation drops using an Echo liquid handler (final concentration, 20% DMSO); drops were incubated for approximately 1 to 3 hours before mounting and flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. 
        Data were collected at the I04-1 beamline at 100 K and automatically processed with Diamond Light Source's autoprocessing pipelines using XDS (9) and either [xia2](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444913015308) or [DIALS](https://doi.org/10.1107/s2059798317017235). 
        Further analysis was performed with [XChemExplorer](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798316020234), electron density maps were generated with DIMPLE and ligand-binding events were identified using [PanDDA](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15123). 
        Ligands were modeled into PanDDA-calculated event maps using Coot, restraints were calculated with [AceDRG](http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2059798317000067), and structures were refined with [BUSTER](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444992010400).
