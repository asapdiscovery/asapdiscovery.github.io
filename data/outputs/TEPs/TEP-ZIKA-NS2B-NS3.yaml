  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: >
    The NS3 protease from Zika virus is expressed with the NS2B cofactor needed for activity. This TEP provides early tools to develop NS3 protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.

  scientific_background: >
    The Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a global public health threat since it was related to major neurological disorders in both infants and adults [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31450-2), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6)].

  conclusion: >
    Here we have established a purification protocol for recombinant NS2b-NS3 protease from Zika viruses and established a robust crystallisation suitable for fragment screening. We have performed a substantial fragment screening campaign and identified many hits.

      protocol: >
        ZIKV NS2B3 was concentrated to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml and apo crystals were grown in crystallisation solution containing 30% PEG 2000, 0.2 M Ammonium sulphate and 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.8 (Molecular Dimensions). Fragments were soaked into crystals as previously described by adding dissolved compounds directly to the crystallisation drops using an Echo liquid handler (final concentration, XX% DMSO); drops were incubated for approximately XX hours before mounting and flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. 
        Data were collected at the I04-1 beamline at 100 K and automatically processed with Diamond Light Source's autoprocessing pipelines using XDS (9) and either [xia2](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444913015308) or [DIALS](https://doi.org/10.1107/s2059798317017235). 
        Further analysis was performed with [XChemExplorer](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798316020234), electron density maps were generated with DIMPLE and ligand-binding events were identified using [PanDDA](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15123). 
        Ligands were modeled into PanDDA-calculated event maps using Coot, restraints were calculated with [AceDRG](http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2059798317000067), and structures were refined with [BUSTER](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444992010400).
