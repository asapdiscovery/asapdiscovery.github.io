  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: |
    This TEP is being compiled to provide early tools to develop NS3 protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins,
    and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.
  # Scientific Background:

  - name: Initial Crystallography with NS2B and NS3 coexpressed protein.
    description: |
      The NS2B-NS3 fusion protein with the catalytically important His mutated to Ala crystallized in various coarse screen conditions. 
      We obtained crystal which diffracted to 1.6 Å, but it is unsuitable for fragment soaking since the active site is occluded.
