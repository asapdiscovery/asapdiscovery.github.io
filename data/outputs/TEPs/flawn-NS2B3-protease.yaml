  summary: |
    This TEP is being compiled to provide early tools to develop NS3 protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins,
    and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.

    protocol: |
      The construct was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells were grown at 37°C in AIM-TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 1, the temperature was lowered to 18°C before induction of protein expression overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1% TX-100, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 mg/mL benzonase]. Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) the column was washed with binding buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The his twin strep tag was removed by digestion with TEV protease and the mixture dialysed overnight against [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP]. Undigested protein, his twin strep tagged protein and his tagged TEV was removed by using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) and the unbound fraction containing untagged protein collected. Protein was lastly purified by SEC (Superose 12 pg, Cytiva) in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required.

      The NS2B-NS3 fusion protein with the catalytically important His mutated to Ala crystallized in various coarse screen conditions. 
      We obtained crystal which diffracted to 1.6 Å, but it is unsuitable for fragment soaking since the active site is occluded.
