  summary: >
    The RdRp is responsible for synthesizing a complementary negative-sense RNA strand that can then be used as a template to produce extra positive-sense RNA genomes. 
  scientific_background: >
    The Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a global public health threat since it was related to major neurological disorders in both infants and adults [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31450-2), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6)]. The non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is the largest non-structural protein from flaviviruses. The N-terminal of NS5 encodes the viral methyltransferase, while the C-terminal encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [[3](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14764)]. The RdRp is responsible for synthesizing a complementary negative-sense RNA strand that can then be used as a template to produce extra positive-sense RNA genomes. Not only critical to viral replication, the flaviviruses RdRp is also a highly conserved multidomain protein, therefore being one of the most valuable targets for the development of new antivirals, including nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogs [[4](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2019.02.014)]. 
  conclusion: >
    Here we have established a purification protocol for recombinant 
    Truncated ZIKV RdRp from Zika viruses and established a robust crystallisation suitable for fragment screening

        # Brief description of the plasmid
        description: |
          Truncated ZIKV RdRp construct bearing a N-terminal His-tag followed by a thioredoxin followed by a TEV-cleavage site.
          This protein construct yielded highly reproducible crystals upon microseeding, which typically diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution. This crystal system was DMSO tolerant and therefore suitable for our subsequent fragment soaking.

        protocol: |
          A synthetic DNA fragment of the ZIKV NS5 (GenBank: AY632535.2) was codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript. The truncated version for crystallization was amplified using primers 5′-CAGGGCGCCATGTACCATGGGAGCTACGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GACCCGACGCGGTTACAACACTCCGGGTGTGG-3′ and inserted into the expression vector pETTrx-1a/LIC by ligation-independent cloning, as previously described [[3](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14764)]. The construct was transformed into the E.coli strain BL21(DE3)-RR and cells were grown at 37˚C in LB media supplemented with kanamycin (50µg/ml) shaking at 250 rpm. After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, the temperature was lowered to 18˚C before induction of protein expression overnight with the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. Shaking was reduced to 160 rpm to slow protein expression. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl 25 mM Imidazole, 5 % (v/v) Glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP-HCl, supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL Lysozyme, 1 X cOmplete™ EDTA free Protease Inhibitor, Benzonase and 2 mM MgCl2). Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) at 4˚C using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva). The sample was incubated with the beads for no more than 15 minutes before the column was washed with binding buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM TCEP] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The sample was desalted using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column (Cytiva) into TEV Cleavage Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % (v/v) Glycerol 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM TCEP-HCl). The tag was removed by rapid digestion with Tev protease at a ratio of 1:10 incubating at room temperature while agitated for 1h. Cleaved tag and un-cleaved protein was removed by using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) and the unbound fraction containing untagged protein collected. Note: Sensitivity to Ni resin of cleaved protein necessitates minimal contact with resin at this point, three passes through a gravity column were used. The resulting protein was pooled, concentrated and injected into a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Cytiva) equilibrated with Gel Filtration Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % (v/v) Glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP-HCl). Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis andd mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required.
