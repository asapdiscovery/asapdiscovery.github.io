  summary: >
    The RdRp is responsible for synthesizing a complementary negative-sense RNA strand that can then be used as a template to produce extra positive-sense RNA genomes. 
  scientific_background: >
    The Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a global public health threat since it was related to major neurological disorders in both infants and adults [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31450-2), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6)]. The non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is the largest non-structural protein from flaviviruses. The N-terminal of NS5 encodes the viral methyltransferase, while the C-terminal encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [[3](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14764)]. The RdRp is responsible for synthesizing a complementary negative-sense RNA strand that can then be used as a template to produce extra positive-sense RNA genomes. Not only critical to viral replication, the flaviviruses RdRp is also a highly conserved multidomain protein, therefore being one of the most valuable targets for the development of new antivirals, including nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogs [[4](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2019.02.014)]. 
  conclusion: >
    Here we have established a purification protocol for recombinant 
    Truncated ZIKV RdRp from Zika viruses and established a robust crystallisation suitable for fragment screening
  
  resources:
      # Construct / plasmid resource
      - name: Truncated ZIKV RdRp construct bearing a N-terminal His-tag followed by a thioredoxin followed by a TEV-cleavage site.
        # Brief description of the plasmid
        description: This protein construct yielded highly reproducible crystals upon microseeding, which typically diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution. This crystal system was DMSO tolerant and therefore suitable for our subsequent fragment soaking.
        # Date it was provided
        date: TBD
        # Type: One of ['plasmid', 'xray-fragment-screen', 'pdb-deposition', 'assay', 'compounds']
        type: plasmid
        protocol: |
          A synthetic DNA fragment of the ZIKV NS5 (GenBank: AY632535.2) was codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript. The truncated version for crystallization was amplified using primers 5′-CAGGGCGCCATGTACCATGGGAGCTACGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GACCCGACGCGGTTACAACACTCCGGGTGTGG-3′ and inserted into the expression vector pETTrx-1a/LIC by ligation-independent cloning, as previously described [[3](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14764)].
