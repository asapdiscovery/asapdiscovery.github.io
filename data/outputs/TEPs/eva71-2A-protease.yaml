  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: >
    This TEP is being compiled to provide early tools to develop 2A protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.
  # Scientific Background:
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  scientific_background: >
    The first cleavage in the enterovirus polyprotein is made by 2A protease's cleaving itself from the capsids. This enables capsid protein folding.  When inhibited, capsid protein folding is deranged.
    2A also cleaves many host proteins, notably eIF4G. Not only does this inhibit the translation of capped (host) transcripts, but a fragment of eIF4G specifically activates viral translation.  There are several other host targets as well.
