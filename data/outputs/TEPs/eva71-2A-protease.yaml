  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: >
    This TEP is being compiled to provide early tools to develop 2A protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.
  # Scientific Background:
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  scientific_background: >
    The first cleavage in the enterovirus polyprotein is made by 2A protease's cleaving itself from the capsids. This enables capsid protein folding.  When inhibited, capsid protein folding is deranged.
    2A also cleaves many host proteins, notably eIF4G. Not only does this inhibit the translation of capped (host) transcripts, but a fragment of eIF4G specifically activates viral translation.  There are several other host targets as well.

        The construct was transformed into the *E. coli* strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells were grown at 37°C in TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 1, the temperature was lowered to 18°C before induction of protein expression overnight by adding 0.5 mM IPTG. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole]. Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) the column was washed with binding buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 1.0 mM TCEP] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The SUMO tag was removed by digestion with SENP1 protease and the mixture dialysed overnight against [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP]. Undigested protein, SUMO tagged protein and his tagged SENP1 was removed by using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) and the unbound fraction containing untagged protein collected.
        Protein was lastly purified by SEC (Superose 12 pg, Cytiva) in a buffer consisting of 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis andd mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required.

    - name: EV-A71 2A protease activity biochemical assay using fluorescence intensity measurements
      id: eva71-3C-protease_biochemical-assay
      description: |
        This method is intended to measure the activity of viral proteases by using a specific labelled-peptide that allows the detection of the cleaved product. The substrate contains the cleavage-sequence specific to the tested protease and is labeled in C-terminal by the fluorophore Edans (ex 336 nm; em: 455 nm) and in N-ternimal by the quencher Dabcyl (abs 472 nm). In the case of a non-cleaved substrate, the proximity of Dabcyl to Edans prevents the emission and the detection of the fluorescence at 455 nm. The cleavage of the peptide by the protease allows Edans’ fluorescence emission and detection.

        Assay buffer: 50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.5 mM DTT (optional).
        Incubation: 1 hour at room temperature.
        EV-A71 2A: protein stocks were stored at -80C and used as 2x solution (20 µM, 10 µM final assay concentration) in assay buffer.
        Substrate: Dabcyl-TAITTLGKFGQE-Edans (LifeTein, USA) prepared as a stock solution at 5 mM in DMSO and used at 2x solution (40 µM, 20  µM final concentration assay concentration) in assay buffer.
        Positive control: Telaprevir (Pubchem CID 3010818), 50 µM top final assay concentration.
        Plates: 384 well plate, white, f-bottom (Greiner #781074).
        Liquid handler: Echo® acoustic liquid handler (Beckman Coulter, USA).
        Plate reader: Pherastar FS, BMG Labtech (Germany), 350-460 FI optic module, the plate is read every 30 s for 2 hours and shacked during 5 s before the first reading.
        Method: Fifty µL of 2x protein solution were added to each well containing the compounds to be tested previously dispensed onto the plate. The mix has been incubated for one hour at room temperature and the enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 µL of 2x (40 µM) substrate solution using the plate reader injector. The fluorescence intensity at 460 nm was read every 30 seconds for 2 hours in kinetic mode, which include a shaking step of the plate between each measurement.
        The IC<50> was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against various concentrations of tested inhibitor by using a four parameter dose−response curve in Prism (v8.0) software.
