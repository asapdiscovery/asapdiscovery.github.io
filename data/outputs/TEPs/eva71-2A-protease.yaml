  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: >
    This TEP is being compiled to provide early tools to develop 2A protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.
  # Scientific Background:
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  scientific_background: >
    The first cleavage in the enterovirus polyprotein is made by 2A protease's cleaving itself from the capsids. This enables capsid protein folding.  When inhibited, capsid protein folding is deranged.
    2A also cleaves many host proteins, notably eIF4G. Not only does this inhibit the translation of capped (host) transcripts, but a fragment of eIF4G specifically activates viral translation.  There are several other host targets as well.

        The construct was transformed into the *E. coli* strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells were grown at 37°C in TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 1, the temperature was lowered to 18°C before induction of protein expression overnight by adding 0.5 mM IPTG. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1% TX-100, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 mg/mL benzonase]. Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) the column was washed with binding buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The SUMO tag was removed by digestion with SENP1 protease and the mixture dialysed overnight against [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP]. Undigested protein, SUMO tagged protein and his tagged SENP1 was removed by using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) and the unbound fraction containing untagged protein collected.
        Protein was lastly purified by SEC (Superose 12 pg, Cytiva) in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis andd mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required.
