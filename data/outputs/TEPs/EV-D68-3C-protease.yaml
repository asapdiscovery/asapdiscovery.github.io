  conclusion: >
    Here we have established a purification protocol for recombinant 3C 
    protease from enterovirus D68 and established a robust crystallisation 
    suitable for fragment screening. We have performed a substantial fragment 
    screening campaign and identified many hits which were validated by 
    biophysical assays established in this work. The ligands and assays 
    established in this work will pave the way for future drug discovery 
    endeavours targeting enterovirus D68 3C protease.

    - name: enterovirus D68 3C protease construct bearing a C-terminal His-
        tag that crystallised in the space group P21<sub>21</sub>21
      # Brief description of the plasmid
      description:  This protein yielded highly reproducible crystals upon 
        microseeding, which typically diffracted to 1.7 Å resolution. This crystal 
        system was DMSO tolerant and therefore suitable for our subsequent fragment
        soaking.

        For expression of protein used for crystallisation, the construct 
        was transformed into the E. coli Rosetta strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells 
        were grown at 37°C in TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 g/ml). 
        After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 1, the temperature 
        was lowered to 18°C before induction of protein expression overnight by 
        adding 0.5 mM IPTG. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM
        Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1% 
        TX-100, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 mg/mL benzonase]. Proteins were first 
        purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-
        Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytive) the column was washed with binding buffer [10
        mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP] 
        and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. 
        Protein was lastly purified by SEC (Superose 12 pg,Cytiva) in a buffer 
        consisting of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM 
        TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
        andd mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -
        80°C until required.

        Fragments were soaked into crystals as previously described
        by adding dissolved compounds directly to the crystallisation drops using 
        an Echo liquid handler (final concentration, 10% DMSO); drops were 
        incubated for approximately 1 to 3 hours before mounting and flash-freezing
        in liquid nitrogen. 
        Data were collected at the I04-1 beamline at 100 K and 
        automatically processed with Diamond Light Source's autoprocessing 
        pipelines using XDS (9) and either 
        [xia2](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444913015308) or 
        [DIALS](https://doi.org/10.1107/s2059798317017235). 
        Further analysis was performed with 
        [XChemExplorer](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798316020234), electron 
        density maps were generated with DIMPLE and ligand-binding events were 
        identified using [PanDDA](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15123). 
        Ligands were modeled into PanDDA-calculated event maps using Coot, 
        restraints were calculated with 
        [AceDRG](http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2059798317000067), and structures were 
        refined with [BUSTER](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444992010400). 
        Coordinates, structure factors, and PanDDA event maps for the 
        structures discussed are deposited in the Protein Data Bank.
    - name: FRET activity assay
      protocol: >
        Assay buffer: 50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol ±0.5 mM DTT
        Incubation temperature: room temperature.
        EV-D68 3C: protein stocks were stored at -80C and used as 2x solution 
          (2 μM, 1 μM final) in assay buffer.
        Substrate: Dabcyl-KEALFQGPPQFE-Edans (LifeTein, USA) was prepared as a 
          stock solution at 5 mM in DMSO and used in the assay at 2x solution (40 μM,
          20 μM final concentration) in assay buffer.
        Assay plate: ProxiPlate-384 Plus, white 384-shallow well microplate, 
          (Greiner bio-one Austria)
        Liquid handler: Echo® acoustic liquid handler (Beckman Coulter, USA)
        Plate reader: Pherastar FS, BMG Labtech (Germany), 350-490 FI optic-module.
          Ten μL of 2x protein solution were added to each well containing the 
          compounds to be tested previously dispensed onto the plate and incubate 
          with the enzyme for one hour at room temperature. Enzymatic reaction was 
          initiated by the addition of 10 uL of 2x (40 μM) substrate solution using 
          the plate reader injector. The fluorescence intensity at 490 nm was read 
          every 30 seconds for 2 hours in kinetic mode (gain 500, 5 flashes, and 
          focal height of 11.5 mm) by the plate reader.
          The IC50 was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against various 
          concentrations of testing inhibitor by using a four parameters 
          dose-response curve in Prism (v8.0) software.

        Plate format: SwissCI 3 lens
        Screen: 0.1M Tris (pH 8.14), 0.2M Ammonium acetate, 25% w/v PEG 3350
        Reservoir volume: 30 μl
        Protein needed: 32ul per full plate
          EV D68 seeds (1:100,000), 16ul per full plate
        Drop ratio:  1:2:0.5 
        ratio of EVD68: 
        reservoir solution: seeds / 100nl of 
        EVD68: 200nl 
        reservoir solution: 50nl seeds
        Final volume: 350 nl
        Incubation temperature: 20°C in Formulatrix
        Imaging Schedule: first images after 12hrs and then following a Fibonacci 
          sequence of days for further image collections.
          Crystal typically form after ~12hrs, after 24hrs they have reached their 
          maximum size and most of the precipitant has gone. Crystals typically 
          either form on their own or in a small cluster of 4-6, giving a flower like
          arrangement. However, upon mounting a gentle nudge dissociates the 
          formation. 
        Morphology: typically thin rectangles with pointed ends. 
        Size:  ~100um in length and ~50um in width, depth of the crystals is ~10um,
          giving a glass shard appearance (see image below).
