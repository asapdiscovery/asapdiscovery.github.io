  summary: >
      The non-structural protein 15 (NSP15, NendoU SARS-CoV-2) from severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) is an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, likely responsible in the viral immune evasion mechanism. This TEP provides a set of reagents for further interrogation of the molecular function of NSP15. We have established a purification protocol for the active protein for biochemical and structural studies. Moreover, we have crystallised the protein and performed a crystallographic fragment screen which yielded several hits. Data generated here will be used for the development of enzyme inhibitors that would illuminate the biological role of the gene product, and eventually point the way to new antiviral therapies.

  scientific_background: >
    SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. NSP15 from SARS-CoV-2 is a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease that is part of the EndoU family [[1](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3873)]. Members of the family act on RNA processing being active on both single-stranded RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA, cleaving 3’of urydilates thereby generating a 2’, 3’ cyclic phosphate and 5’-hydroxyl termini [[2](https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.8.2.15196)]. NSP15 domains are highly conserved amongst all nidoviruses and have not been identified in other RNA virus families, thus qualifying them as genetic markers of this order [[3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2006.01.017), [4](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403127101)]. Initially, NSP15 was thought to be required for the viral replication process, acting on viral RNA synthesis. However, studies have revealed that catalytic mutant viruses for NSP15 replicate as well as wild-type virus [[5](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006195)]. Subsequently, it was revealed that NSP15 acts by limiting the sensing of viral RNA by the host, inhibiting the innate immune response, like type I interferon response in macrophages during viral infection by evading dsRNA sensors (such as MDA5, PKR and OAS/RNaseL) [[5](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006195), [6](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1618310114), [7](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921485117)]. The potential of NSP15 as a target for direct acting antiviral therapies has not been yet fully explored.

  conclusion: >
    We have produced active recombinant NSP15 protein that could be crystallised and used for structure determination at high resolution. We also obtained data from the NSP15 in complex with several fragments, which should provide valuable information for the development of a new enzyme inhibitor. Furthermore, we established a stable assay that can be used for further enzyme characterization.

      # Brief description of the plasmid
      description:  NSP15 is a346 amino acid long polypeptide of approximately 38 kDa that forms a three-domain protein.
            These monomers are known to self-assemble as a barrel-shaped hexamer with D3 symmetry, totalling 228
            kDa. For this project, we recombinantly purified NSP15 in its monomeric form. The mechanism involved in
            hexamerisation in-vitro and in-situ is still under investigation. Although recombinant protein obtained was monomeric, crystal packing revealed that NSP15 formed the expected hexamer during crystallization. The active site of NSP15 [[2](https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.8.2.15196)] was found to be in complex with citrate, which is a component of the crystallisation condition.
            We have produced active recombinant NSP15 protein that could be crystallised and used for structure determination at high resolution.

        SARS-CoV-2 cDNA sample was donated by Dr. Edilson Durigon (GenBank MT126808.1), generated using SCRIPT One-Step RT-PCR (Cellco Biotec) and random hexamer primers. NSP15 coding sequence was amplified using
        FastPol (Cellco Biotec) with primers 5’-CAGGGCGCCATGAGTTTAGAAAATGTGGCTTTTAATG-3’ and 5’-GACCCGACGCGGTTATTGTAATTTTGGGTAAAATGTTTCTAC-3’, and inserted pET28-LIC (donated by Dr.
        Arie Geerlof) using Ligation-Independent Cloning method (8). The final construct pET28-LIC -NSP15 included a N-terminal 6xHis-tag followed by a TEV cleaving site and residues 1-346 of NSP15.
        Buffers used are detailed hereafter: 
        Buffer A: 50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole
        Buffer B: 50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 300 mM imidazole
        Buffer C: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP
        Transformed *BL21(DE3)* cells were grown in LB Lennox medium supplemented with kanamycin at 37^o^C until OD~600~ = 1.0, and kept for 16h at 18^o^C after induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside.
        Harvested cells were resuspended in Buffer A supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme, 10 U of benzonase (Cellco Biotec) and 1.0 mM DTT, and disrupted using sonication. Cleared lysate was passed through a HisTrap
        HP 5 mL (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A, and them protein was eluted with Buffer B. Excessive imidazole was removed using a Sephadex XK 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A. Sample
        was incubated overnight at 8^o^C with 4 mM DTT and 0.1 mg/mL TEV protease, then passed through a HisTrap HP 5 mL equilibrated in Buffer A to remove non-cleaved protein and TEV protease. Final purification was
        performed by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer C. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE 12%. Protein concentration was estimated using the
        theoretical extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 33,140 M^-1^.cm^-1^. The eluted protein was pooled and concentrated to 3.4 mg/mL using a 30 kDa MWCO concentrator.
