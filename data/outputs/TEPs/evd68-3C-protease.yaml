  # Summary of Project
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  summary: >
    The conserved 3C protease of enterovirus D68 is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein.
    This TEP aims to provide early tools for structure-based discovery of 3C protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.
  # Scientific Background
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  scientific_background: >
    While enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild or severe, it can also cause [acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)](https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/index.html), a serious neurological condition which mostly affects children that causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak (via [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html)).
    Enterovirus 3C protease is required to cleave the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein. 
    3C also cleaves many host proteins to facilitate viral infection; thus, inhibition can reinstate the antiviral functions of some of these targets.
    The protease has a typical chymotrypsin fold with a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad.
  # Scientific Background

  conclusion: >
    Here we have established a purification protocol for recombinant 3C 
    protease from enterovirus D68 and established a robust crystallisation 
    suitable for fragment screening. We have performed a substantial fragment 
    screening campaign and identified many hits which were validated by 
    biophysical assays established in this work. The ligands and assays 
    established in this work will pave the way for future drug discovery 
    endeavours targeting enterovirus D68 3C protease.

        Enterovirus D68 3C protease construct bearing a C-terminal His-tag that crystallised in the space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>. This protein yielded highly reproducible crystals upon 
        microseeding, which typically diffracted to 1.7 Å resolution. This crystal system was DMSO tolerant and therefore suitable for our subsequent fragment soaking.

        The construct was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells were grown at 37°C in TB autoinduction medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 2, the temperature was lowered to 18°C for 24h to allow autoinduction through lactose metabolism was triggered overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5mM TCEP] with addition of 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 mg/mL benzonase. Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) the column was washed with wash buffer [10 mM Bicine pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5mM TCEP, 30mM imidazole] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. Protein was lastly purified by SEC (sepax SEC SRT-100) in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Bicine pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5mM TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis andd mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required.

    - name: Biochemical assay protocol for EV-D68 3C protease activity measurements using fluorescence detection
      id: evd68-3C-protease_protocol-biochemical
      description: This method is intended to measure the activity of viral proteases by using a specific labelled-peptide that allows the detection of the cleaved product. The substrate contains the cleavage-sequence specific to the tested protease and is labeled in C-terminal by the fluorophore Edans (abs 336 nm; em 490 nm) and in N-terminal by the quencher Dabcyl (abs 472 nm). In the case of a non-cleaved substrate, the proximity of Dabcyl to Edans prevents the emission and the detection of the fluorescence at 490 nm. The cleavage of the peptide by the protease allows Edans’ fluorescence emission and detection.

        Assay buffer: 50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.5 mM DTT (optional).
        Incubation: 1 hour at room temperature.
        EV-D68 3C: protein stocks were stored at -80C and used as 2x solution (1 µM, 0.5 µM final assay concentration) in assay buffer.
        Substrate: Dabcyl-KEALFQGPPQFE-Edans (LifeTein, USA) prepared as a stock solution at 5 mM in DMSO and used at 2x solution (40 µM, 20  µM final concentration assay concentration) in assay buffer.
        Positive control: GC376 (Pubchem CID 71481119), 50  µM top final assay concentration.
        Plates: ProxiPlate-384 Plus, white, Greiner cat# 6008280.
        Liquid handler: Echo® acoustic liquid handler (Beckman Coulter, USA)
        Plate reader: Pherastar FS, BMG Labtech (Germany), 350-490 FI optic module, the plate is read every 30 s for 2 hours and shacked during 5 s before the first reading.
        Protocol EV-D68 3C Pro:
        Ten µL of 2x protein solution were added to each well containing the compounds to be tested previously dispensed onto the plate and incubate with the enzyme for one hour at room temperature. Enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 uL of 2x (40 µM) substrate solution using the plate reader injector. The fluorescence intensity at 490 nm was read every 30 seconds for 2 hours in kinetic mode.
        The IC50 was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against various concentrations of tested inhibitor by using a four parameter dose−response curve in Prism (v8.0) software.

        Imaging Schedule: first images after 12hrs and then following a Fibonacci sequence of days for further image collections.
          Crystal typically form after ~12hrs, after 24hrs they have reached their maximum size and most of the precipitant has gone. Crystals typically either form on their own or in a small cluster of 4-6, giving a flower like  arrangement. However, upon mounting a gentle nudge dissociates the formation. 
        Morphology: typically thin rectangles with pointed ends. 
        Size:  ~100um in length and ~50um in width, depth of the crystals is ~10um, giving a glass shard appearance (see image below).

        Fragments were soaked into crystals as previously described by 
        adding dissolved compounds directly to the crystallisation drops using an 
        Echo liquid handler (final concentration, 10% DMSO); drops were incubated 
        for approximately 1 to 3 hours before mounting and flash-freezing in liquid
        nitrogen.   
        Data were collected at the I04-1 beamline at 100 K and 
        automatically processed with Diamond Light Source's autoprocessing 
        pipelines using XDS (9) and either
