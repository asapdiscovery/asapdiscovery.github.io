  summary: >
    The NS3 protease from Zika virus is expressed with the NS2B cofactor needed for activity. This TEP provides early tools to develop NS3 protease inhibitors, including purification protocols of recombinant proteins, and reproducible crystallisation condition suitable for X-ray crystallography fragment screening.
  # Scientific Background:

  scientific_background: >
    The Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a global public health threat since it was related to major neurological disorders in both infants and adults [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31450-2), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6)].

  # Scientific Background
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide    
  conclusion: >
    Here we have established a purification protocol for recombinant NS2b-NS3 protease from Zika viruses and established a robust crystallisation suitable for fragment screening. We have performed a substantial fragment screening campaign and identified many hits.

        The construct was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RR, and cells were grown at 37°C in AIM-TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After reaching an optical density at 600 nm of around 1, the temperature was lowered to 18°C before induction of protein expression overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1% TX-100, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 mg/mL benzonase]. Proteins were first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) the column was washed with binding buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP] and target protein eluted using same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The his twin strep tag was removed by digestion with TEV protease and the mixture dialysed overnight against [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP]. Undigested protein, his twin strep tagged protein and his tagged TEV was removed by using Ni-Sepharose 6 FF resin (Cytiva) and the unbound fraction containing untagged protein collected. Protein was lastly purified by SEC (Superose 12 pg, Cytiva) in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP. Proteins were characterised by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spec and then flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required.

        ZIKV NS2B3 was concentrated to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml and apo crystals were grown in crystallisation solution containing 30% PEG 2000, 0.2 M Ammonium sulphate and 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.8 (Molecular Dimensions). Fragments (libraries: DSIPoised, Probing all fragments, SpotXplorer, CovHetLib) were soaked into crystals as previously described by adding dissolved compounds directly to the crystallisation drops using an Echo liquid handler (final concentration, XX% DMSO); drops were incubated for approximately XX hours before mounting and flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. 
        Data were collected at the I04-1 beamline at 100 K and automatically processed with Diamond Light Source's autoprocessing pipelines using XDS (9) and either [xia2](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444913015308) or [DIALS](https://doi.org/10.1107/s2059798317017235). 
        Further analysis was performed with [XChemExplorer](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS2059798316020234), electron density maps were generated with DIMPLE and ligand-binding events were identified using [PanDDA](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15123). 
        Ligands were modeled into PanDDA-calculated event maps using Coot, restraints were calculated with [AceDRG](http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2059798317000067), and structures were refined with [BUSTER](https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444992010400).
