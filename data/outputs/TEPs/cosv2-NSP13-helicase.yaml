  summary: >
    To contribute towards the development of novel anti-viral therapeutics targeting the current and future
    emerging coronavirus threats, the Gileadi lab at the University of Oxford, together with the XChem team at
    Diamond Light Source, have teamed up to perform a crystallographic fragment screen against SARS-CoV-2
    NSP13 helicase. NSP13 is believed to act in concert with the replication-transcription complex
    (NSP7/NSP82/NSP12), possibly being involved in either disrupting downstream RNA secondary structures
    or template switching, and plays an essential role in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.
    This TEP includes expression clones and methods for producing the full length NSP13, and fluorescencebased activity assays suitable for compound screening. We provide a crystallisation system that produces
    reproducible crystals that diffract to high resolution, and have performed a crystallographic fragment
    screen revealing 63 fragment hits across 51 datasets. The fragment hits include several hits in pockets
    predicted to be of functional importance, including the nucleotide and nucleic acid binding sites, opening
    the way to development of novel antiviral agents.
  # Scientific Background:
  # This is Markdown: See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for guide
  scientific_background: >
    SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a severe
    respiratory disease that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9)]. Coronaviruses belong to the
    order Nidovirales which have a positive strand RNA genome that is amongst the largest know RNA genomes
    (approximately 30 KB in length). The main SARS-CoV genome encodes two open reading frames ORF1a and
    1b, that when translated produce polyproteins that are processed by proteases into 16 non-structural
    proteins (NSP1-16)[[2](https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902)] that collectively form the machinery for viral replication and transcription. The NSP13
    helicase is believed to act in concert with the replication-transcription complex (NSP7/NSP82/NSP12)[[3](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cell.2020.07.033)] and
    is a critical component for viral replication [[4](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz409)]. NSP13 is among the most conserved of the non-structural
    proteins, sharing only a single amino acid (V570I) difference with SARS-CoV-1. Thus, compounds targeting
    SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 would likely be effective against SARS-CoV-1 and potentially other future emerging
    coronaviruses, making it an ideal target for the development of new antiviral therapeutics.
    NSP13 is a large 67 kDa protein that belongs to the helicase superfamily 1B. It utilises the energy of
    nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis to catalyse the unwinding of double stranded DNA or RNA in a 5’ to 3’
    direction. NSP13 contains 5 domains, a N-terminal zinc binding domain that coordinates 3 structural zinc
    ions, a helical “stalk” domain, a beta-barrel 1B domain and two “RecA like” helicase subdomains 1A and 2A
    that contain the residues responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Possible sites of
    inhibition of NSP13 include the nucleotide binding pocket, the DNA/RNA binding pocket and potentially
    allosteric pockets that may block domain movements that are required as part of the NSP13 catalytic
    cycle. Initial druggability analysis indicates both nucleotide and DNA/RNA binding pockets as being
    druggable and amongst the most well conserved pockets in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome.

  conclusion: >
    NSP13 is an important target for the development of new antiviral compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 and
    other potential emerging viral threats. We describe a robust crystallisation system for NSP13 that produces
    crystals that routinely diffract to high resolution and have performed an X-ray fragment screen to identify
    initial binders. Of particular interest are the large number of hits in the nucleotide binding site and the
    DNA/RNA interface which may be developed into ATP or DNA competitive inhibitors. Alternatively, several
    pockets were discovered at interfaces between domains that could lead to allosteric inhibitors that prevent
    domain movements that occur as part of the helicase catalytic cycle.

      protocol: >
        Medium: Terrific Broth (TB) Merck with 4 ml of glycerol
        Antibiotics: Kanamycin, 50 µg/ml
        From the glycerol stock, bacteria were inoculated in 15 ml of 1 x TB in a 50 ml tube with Kanamycin 0.05
        mg/ml and 0.034 mg/ml of chloramphenicol and grown overnight in a shaker at 37°C, 250rpm. The following
        day, 40 ml of the overnight culture were inoculated in 4L of TB. The bacteria grew in an incubator at 37°C,
        shaking 180 rpm. Once the OD reached 2-3, IPTG (300uM) was added to the media and left overnight at
        18°C, shaking 180 rpm. The pellets were harvested the next following day.
        The pellet (45g cell mass) was re-suspended in 200 ml lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5%
        Gol, 10 mM Imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP) with protease inhibitors (500 Merck set III). Cells were disrupted by
        sonication for 15 mins, 10sec on 5sec off, spin in JA25.5 24500 RPM for 30 mins. The supernatant was
        incubated for 40 mins with 5ml of Ni resin (IAMC sepharose) for batch binding. The tubes containing the lysate
        were centrifuged at 700 x g at 4°C for 5 minutes and the supernatant discarded.
        Beads were loaded on a gravity flow column and washed with 40 ml lysis buffer, 25 ml wash buffer (50 mM
        HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% Gol, 45 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP). A further wash with 10 ml Hi-salt buffer
        (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 5% Gol, 0.5 mM TCEP) and again with another 10 ml of wash buffer. Proteins
        were eluted with addition of 15ml of elution buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% Gol, 300 mM
        imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP).
        Elution fraction was immediately applied to a 5ml HItrap SP column using a syringe, collecting the flow
        through. The SP column was washed with 10ml elution buffer and proteins were eluted with 15ml Hi-salt
        buffer. The NSP13 protein was found to be present in flow-through, wash and elution fractions and these
        fractions were pooled and treated separately from this point onward.
        For further purification both proteins were incubated overnight with TEV protease (1:40 mass ratio) and
        loaded onto gel filtration systems using a superdex 200 16/60 column equilibrated in 50 mM Hepes, 500 mM
        NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP.
        Both pools were found to crystallise with the majority of the crystals coming from the SP flow through and
        wash which had greater yield although slightly dirtier.
        Protein was concentrated to 20 mg /ml and diluted in half with water for initial crystallization trials at 10
        mg/ml using a combination of screens and nucleotide combinations. Total yield was around 6 mg. The protein
        was confirmed by ESI-TOF intact mass spectrometry.

        Initial diffracting crystals were found in the Morpheus screen from Molecular dimensions for the APO form of
        the protein at 10 mg/ml. Initial crystals grew at 20 degrees from conditions containing 20 % Ethylene Glycol,
        10 % PEG 8K, 0.05 M HEPES, 0.05 M MOPS, 0.03 M sodium nitrate, 0.03 M sodium phosphate, 0.03 M
        ammonium sulphate. For crystal optimization seeding was performed, around 5-10 crystals were crushed with
        a glass probe and transferred to 25 μl of well solution. A seed bead was added, and the mixture was sonicated
        for around 30-60 seconds with pulsing. Final seeding was performed with a 1 in 400 dilution of seed stock.
        Final plates were set up with protein at 5 mg/ml (diluted 4 fold in water from 20 mg/ml stock) with a slightly
