    (Working draft---not yet finalized)

    | Property | Minimum Essential | Ideal |
    | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
    | Drug product | oral | oral, IV with oral step down |
    | Dosing regimen | TID | UID |
    | Clinical efficacy | >=0.6 log10 drop in viral load, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; in animal model if no human disease | >= 1 log10 drop in viral load | 
    | Transmission blocking | No | Yes |
    | Bioavailbility / food effect | Predicted >= 30% / fed fasted <3x change | Predicted >= 50% / fed fasted no change |
    | Drug-drug interactions | No unmanageable risk in terms of solid state or PK interactions | No risks in terms of solid state or PK interactions |
    | Safety and tolerability | Few and manageable drug-related SAEs | No drug-related SAEs; minimal drug-related AEs that do not result in study exclusion | 
    | Pregnancy | Not contra-indicated in second or third trimester | Not contra-indicated in second or third trimester, no suggestion of embryo-fetal toxicity in first trimester in preclinical species
    | Shelf life of product | >= 2 years | >= 5 years |
