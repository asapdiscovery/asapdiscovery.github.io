  Martha S. Head (Marti) is Executive Director of Computational and Data Sciences at AMGEN, where she leads a team applying mechanistic and machine-learning computational methods to the understanding of disease biology and the discovery and design of biologic and synthetic therapeutics.  Previously, she was the Director of the Joint Institute for Biological Sciences, a collaborative research effort between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the University of Tennessee system and Director of Computational Biomedical Initiatives at ORNL. As director, she focused on applying the world-leading capabilities of ORNL and UT to biomedical research and health outcomes of relevance to Tennessee and the Appalachian region.
  
  Before joining ORNL, Dr. Head spent 20 years in R&D at GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (GSK). For many of those years, Dr. Head led GSK’s U.S. Computational Chemistry team, whose accountability was to proactively and creatively apply all relevant computational tools to progressing drug discovery efforts from target selection through to selection of a candidate for clinical trials.  In the final years of her time at GSK, Dr. Head led GSK’s collaboration with Palantir, a Silicon Valley data integration and exploration company, and built GSK’s Insights from Data team.  While at GSK, Dr. Head was a co-creator of the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM), a public-private partnership under the auspices of the Cancer Moonshot, and at ORNL continued to be a contributor to ATOM and a member of the ATOM Joint Research Council, and Dr. Head leads the “Molecular design and analysis to inform therapeutics related to COVID-19” project sponsored by the US Department of Energy National Virtual Biotechnology Laboratory. Dr. Head received her PhD in physical chemistry from Duke University in 1995.
