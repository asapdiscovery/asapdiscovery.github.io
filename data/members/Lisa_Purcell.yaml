  Wendy Young is a biotechnology, pharma, and life sciences executive and board advisor with more than 30 years of experience in the discovery and development of innovative new medicines for patients. She has an international reputation for drug discovery impacting human health and has successfully moved numerous molecules from basic research to Investigational New Drug filings in some of the toughest disease areas. From personal experience, she knows the long journey from basic research to a commercially available drug, and has insights on how to overcome the scientific and regulatory hurdles.  She has operated in a global setting and having supervised international teams of scientists across the US, Europe and Asia.  

  Most recently, Wendy joined MPM Capital as an Executive Partner. MPM is a leading VC firm with over 3.6B in assets under management.  In this role, she is supporting new company creation and investments.

In this role, she was an executive member of the R&D leadership team tasked with portfolio and technology management. She led research and oversaw 800 internal and external multi-disciplinary scientists (chemistry, biochemistry, drug metabolism and pharmaceutical sciences) engaged in drug discovery and development. She routinely presented to the Genentech and Roche Board of Directors.  She rose rapidly through the ranks in Genentech, where she was an acknowledged motivational leader and had proven firsthand successes. 

  Wendy has a strong track record of drug discovery accomplishments having led the research team and co-inventor of fenebrutinib, a selective Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is currently in Phase III trials in multiple sclerosis, and has completed Phase II trials in additional immunology indications (MS, RA, lupus, urticaria). Under her guidance at Genentech, over 25 clinical candidates have been discovered in several clinical indications and nominated for development. With a strong passion for innovative research and basic science, Wendy is named as an inventor or author on over 70 published patents and  manuscripts.
