## ASAP Resources
ASAP maintains several open community resources to help foster a global antiviral discovery pipeline:
* Mutational fitness scans from analysis of circulating variants: [SARS-CoV-2](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/)
* Wetlab protocols are hosted at the [ASAP protocols.io page](https://protocols.io/workspaces/asap-discovery)
* ASAP talks and datasets at the [ASAP Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/asapdrugdiscovery/?page=1&size=20)
* ASAP plasmid resources are available through the [ASAP AddGene page](http://addgene.org/asap) under the permissive [OpenMTA](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4263) whenever possible
* ASAP compounds are available through [Enamine](https://enamine.net/) without the need for an MTA
* Recorded talks on the [ASAP YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJDt-ivduVKzjnK9XmCSlmQ) and [Open Antivirals YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AViDD-OSF) channels
* The [Open Antiviral Discovery Forum](http://openantivirals.org) enables multiple AViDD Centers to rapidly share information and resources for antiviral drug discovery

# ASAP Research Outputs

ASAP is an [open science antiviral discovery center](https://www.choderalab.org/news/2021/10/26/asap-avidd-proposal) that aims to make all research outputs openly available as rapidly as possible to build a global antiviral discovery pipeline.
Below, we give an overview of all classes of ASAP's research outputs:

<!-- TODO: Move these details to a YAML file so we can programmatically include them in auto-generated RPPRs? -->

<!-- Viral family -->
<a id="viral-family"></a>
#### Viral Family

The **viral family** describes the family of viruses ASAP aims to develop antivirals against.
ASAP aims to discover direct-acting antivirals with broad antiviral activity within a viral family, but the difficulty of achieving this goal means that some of our program objectives are more narrowly focused on viral family members of greatest pandemic concern.

<!-- Targeting opportunity -->
<a id="targeting-opportunity"></a>
#### Targeting Opportunity

A **targeting opportunity** provides an overview of the opportunity for targeting new antivirals to a specific target protein and mode of action.
This overview is intended to summarize relevant information for drug hunters, including the relevant domain and binding sites to target, notable chemical matter, rationale for antiviral effects, and other useful information in prosecuting a discovery compaign aginst the target.

<!-- Molecules -->
<a id="molecules"></a>
#### Molecules

ASAP is synthesizing and assaying new molecules against numerous antiviral targets, and posting these publicly as part of our open science mission.

<!-- Structures -->
<a id="structures"></a>
#### Structures

[Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/) is a full partner in ASAP, producing numerous X-ray structures of molecules bound to antiviral targets.

<!-- Publications -->
<a id="publications"></a>
#### Publications

ASAP aims to publish preprints of all work to ensure our scientific advances are rapidly and openly available to all.

<!-- Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) data -->
<a id="mutational-data"></a>
#### Target Mutational Data

**Deep mutational scanning (DMS)** data helps identify mutations in the target that are functionally tolerated and could lead to resistance should these mutations abrogate binding of antivirals.
ASAP is using multiple techniques to rapidly generate DMS data for all targets of interest in order to inform the discovery of resistance-robust direct-acting antivirals.
ASAP is also pursuing **analysis of circulating variants** of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses to identify functionally tolerated mutations to inform resistance-robust inhibitor discovery.

<!-- Target Product Profiles (TPPs) -->
<a id="target-product-profile"></a>
#### Target Product Profile (TPP)

A **[Target Product Profile (TPP)](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/analyses-and-syntheses/target-product-profile/who-target-product-profiles)** describes the desired characteristics of a drug product aimed to treat a particular disease or set of diseases.
All ASAP TPPs are *draft TPPs* intended to help guide the development of target candidate profiles (TCPs) for antiviral discovery within the ASAP Discovery Consortium.
ASAP works with stakeholders around the globe (such as the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/analyses-and-syntheses/target-product-profile/who-target-product-profiles)) to align TPPs to ensure they meet the needs of communities and fulfill our mission of global, equitable, and affordable access to antiviral therapies.

<!-- Target Candidate Profiles (TCPs) -->
<a id="target-candidate-profile"></a>
#### Target Candidate Profile (TCP)

A [Target Candidate Profile (TCP)](https://www.mmv.org/research-development/information-scientists/target-product-profiles-target-candidate-profiles) describes the objectives an ASAP drug discovery program aims to achieve to produce a preclinical candidate.
Our TCPs are informed by the corresponding [Target Product Profiles (TPPs)](#target-product-profile) for the corresponding disease.

<!-- Assay Cascades -->
<a id="assay-cascade"></a>
#### Assay cascades

An **[assay cascade](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Drug-discovery-assay-cascade-Example-assay-cascade-for-drug-discovery-and-where-3D_fig2_348991791)** is a defined set of assays and progression criteria used by a drug discovery program to achieve its [Target Candidate Profile (TCP)](#target-candidate-profile) goals in a time- and cost-effective manner.

<!-- Target Enabling Package (TEP) -->
<a id="target-enabling-package"></a>
#### Target Enabling Package (TEP)

A [Target Enabling Package (TEP)](https://www.thesgc.org/tep) is a complete data package needed to enable structure-based drug discovery against an antiviral target.
Pioneered by the [Structural Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org/tep), each TEP contains relevant protein constructs and plasmid resources for one or more viral family members, protein expression and purification protocols, crystallization conditions, structures from an [X-ray fragment screen at the Diamond Light Source XChem facility](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html), small molecule hits, and biochemical assay protocols with at least one validated inhibitor with quantifiable activity.
