# ASAP Research Outputs

ASAP is an [open science antiviral discovery center](https://www.choderalab.org/news/2021/10/26/asap-avidd-proposal) that aims to make all research outputs openly available as rapidly as possible to build a global antiviral discovery pipeline.
Below, we give an overview of all classes of ASAP's research outputs:

<!-- TODO: Move these details to a YAML file so we can programmatically include them in auto-generated RPPRs? -->

<!-- Viral family -->
<a id="viral-family"></a>
#### Viral Family

The **viral family** describes the family of viruses ASAP aims to develop antivirals against.
ASAP aims to discover direct-acting antivirals with broad antiviral activity within a viral family, but the difficulty of achieving this goal means that some of our program objectives are more narrowly focused on viral family members of greatest pandemic concern.

<!-- Targeting opportunity -->
<a id="targeting-opportunity"></a>
#### Targeting Opportunity

A **targeting opportunity** provides an overview of the opportunity for targeting new antivirals to a specific target protein and mode of action.
This overview is intended to summarize relevant information for drug hunters, including the relevant domain and binding sites to target, notable chemical matter, rationale for antiviral effects, and other useful information in prosecuting a discovery compaign aginst the target.

<!-- Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) data -->
<a id="DMS"></a>
#### Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) data

**Deep mutational scanning (DMS)** data helps identify mutations in the target that are functionally tolerated and could lead to resistance should these mutations abrogate binding of antivirals.
ASAP is using multiple techniques to rapidly generate DMS data for all targets of interest in order to inform the discovery of resistance-robust direct-acting antivirals.

<!-- Target Product Profiles (TPPs) -->
<a id="TPP"></a>
#### Target Product Profile (TPP)

A **[Target Product Profile (TPP)](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/analyses-and-syntheses/target-product-profile/who-target-product-profiles)** describes the desired characteristics of a drug product aimed to treat a particular disease or set of diseases.
All ASAP TPPs are *draft TPPs* intended to help guide the development of target candidate profiles (TCPs) for antiviral discovery within the ASAP Discovery Consortium.
ASAP works with stakeholders around the globe (such as the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/analyses-and-syntheses/target-product-profile/who-target-product-profiles)) to align TPPs to ensure they meet the needs of communities and fulfill our mission of global, equitable, and affordable access to antiviral therapies.

<!-- Target Candidate Profiles (TCPs) -->
<a id="TCP"></a>
#### Target Candidate Profile (TCP)

A [Target Candidate Profile (TCP)]() describes the objectives an ASAP drug discovery program aims to achieve to produce a preclinical candidate.
Our TCPs are informed by the corresponding [Target Product Profiles (TPPs)](#TPP) for the corresponding disease.

<!-- Target Candidate Profiles (TCPs) -->
<a id="assay-cascade"></a>
#### Assay cascades

An **[assay cascade]() is a defined set of assays and progression criteria used by a drug discovery program to achieve its [Target Candidate Profile (TCP)](#TCP) goals in a time- and cost-effective manner.


<!-- Target Enabling Package (TEP) -->
<a id="TEP"></a>
#### Target Enabling Package (TEP)

A [Target Enabling Package (TEP)](https://www.thesgc.org/tep) is a complete data package needed to enable structure-based drug discovery against an antiviral target.
Pioneered by the [Structural Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org/tep), each TEP contains
* Relevant protein construct and links to procure plasmids for one or more viral family members
* Protein expression and purification protocols 
* Crystallization conditions
* Structures from an [X-ray fragment screen](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html) and other small molecule hits
* Biochemical assay protocols with a validated inhibitor with quantifiable activity

<!-- Investigational New Drug (IND) approval -->
<a id="IND"></a>
#### Investigational New Drug (IND) approval


<!-- Clinical trials -->
<a id="clinical-trials"></a>
#### Clinical trials

ASAP collaborates with downstream translational partners to carry the clinical candidates it discovers into clinical trials.
Note that the [AViDD U19 grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AI-21-050.html) held by ASAP is not used to fund clinical trials.


<!-- NDA -->
<a id="NDA"></a>
#### New Drug Approval (NDA)

ASAP aims to work with partners to seek New Drug Approvals (NDAs) and carry our antivirals to manufacture with the goal of globally accessible and affordable therapeutics.
