The Open Science Forum features monthly talks from scientists from NIH-funded [Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Centers](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/antiviral-drug-discovery-centers-pathogens-pandemic-concern) who elect to provide updates on target priorities, advertise available resources and reagents, disclose chemical matter (such as hits, leads, and chemical tool compounds) and associated antiviral data, share findings regarding in vivo efficacy models, discuss downstream development and translation models, and share ideas.

Talks will be public, recorded, and shared online along with links to relevant resources and reagents for the benefit of other AViDD Centers and the global antiviral drug discovery community.

An unrecorded discussion with the speakers follows each pair of talks for those that wish to discuss the science behind the work more deeply.

**NOTE: The AViDD Open Science Forum is not an official NIAID activity. There is no requirement for staff from AViDD Centers or the NIH to participate in this forum.**

# Event format

Each monthly Open Science Forum event will be a one-hour webinar featuring two short scientific talks followed by an optional 30-minute moderated discussion with the speakers:

**Science talks (recorded, webinar format)**
* Talk 1 : 25 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A
* Talk 2 : 25 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A

**Moderated discussion with speakers (unrecorded, Zoom meeting format)**
* Talk 1 : 30 minutes

Each recorded talk will be posted online after the event, along with relevant links to publications, data, reagents, or other resources discussed by the speaker that may be useful in disseminating resources or reagents for global antiviral discovery.
