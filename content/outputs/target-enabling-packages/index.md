A [Target Enabling Package (TEP)](https://www.thesgc.org/tep) is a complete data package needed to enable structure-based drug discovery against an antiviral target.
Pioneered by the [Structural Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org/tep), each TEP contains relevant protein constructs and plasmid resources for one or more viral family members, protein expression and purification protocols, crystallization conditions, structures from an [X-ray fragment screen at the Diamond Light Source XChem facility](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html), small molecule hits, and biochemical assay protocols with at least one validated inhibitor with quantifiable activity.
