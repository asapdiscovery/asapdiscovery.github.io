A **[Target Product Profile (TPP)](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/analyses-and-syntheses/target-product-profile/who-target-product-profiles)** describes the desired characteristics of a drug product aimed to treat a particular disease or set of diseases.

All ASAP TPPs are *draft TPPs* intended to help guide the development of target candidate profiles (TCPs) for antiviral discovery within the ASAP Discovery Consortium.
ASAP works with stakeholders around the globe (such as the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/analyses-and-syntheses/target-product-profile/who-target-product-profiles)) to align TPPs to ensure they meet the needs of communities and fulfill our mission of global, equitable, and affordable access to antiviral therapies.
