### MERS-CoV Main Protease (Mpro) Fluorescence Dose Response
This is a functional, biochemical assay used to identify treatments for viral infectious disease in MERS 3C-like main viral protease. 
Utilizing a direct enzyme activity measurement method, the experiment was performed in a 384-well plate reading the fluorescence intensity. This assay tested the mode of action of inhibition.
