ASAP aims to discover direct-acting antivirals with broad antiviral activity within a viral family, but the difficulty of achieving this goal means that some of our program objectives are more narrowly focused on viral family members of greatest pandemic concern.

### coronaviridae

Coronavirus antiviral discovery is funded by [NIAID grant U19AI171399 from the National Institutes of Health](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/EpbjKrq7Kki8EBHx4eMWbw/project-details/10513865).

### flaviviridae

Flavivirus antiviral discovery is funded by [NIAID grant U19AI171399 from the National Institutes of Health](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/EpbjKrq7Kki8EBHx4eMWbw/project-details/10513865).

### picornaviridae

Picornavirus antiviral discovery is funded by [NIAID grant U19AI171399 from the National Institutes of Health](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/EpbjKrq7Kki8EBHx4eMWbw/project-details/10513865).

### influenza

ASAP is not currently funded to pursue antiviral discovery for pandemic influenza, but is very interested in exploring opportunities for funding discovery programs in this area.

### togaviridae

ASAP is not currently funded to pursue antiviral discovery for pandemic influenza, but is collaborating with the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on an early-stage discovery program to identify novel chemical hits for togavirus targets.
This work is entirely carried out by NCATS.

### other viral families

ASAP is interested in expanding its efforts to target other viral families not listed here.
Contact Maggie Jameson `<maggie.jameson@choderalab.org>` if you are interested in funding discovery in these areas.
