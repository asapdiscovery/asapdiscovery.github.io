**Award Budget**<br>
Application budgets are limited to $200,000/year direct costs and must reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.

**Award Project Period**<br>

**Required Application Components**
* Three page white paper proposal (minimum 0.5” margins and 11pt font) inclusive of figures
    * Include clearly defined aims and a justification for why the proposed work addresses a major challenge and complements the [ASAP Discovery Consortium objectives](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/530562f9e4b06fd3c041e221/t/61788fa74126c33373345e2f/1635291049659/ASAP+-+Overall+component.pdf).

    * Budget must follow NIH guidelines
    * Project leader must commit a minimum of 1.2 cal person months effort per year
* Institutional F&A negotiated rate agreement 

**Background**<br>
Developmental awards must be closely aligned with the [objectives of existing ASAP Discovery Consortium Projects and Cores as described in the parent application](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/530562f9e4b06fd3c041e221/t/61788fa74126c33373345e2f/1635291049659/ASAP+-+Overall+component.pdf). Efforts are expected to focus on coronavirus, flavivirus, and/or picornavirus families.
Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.

**Research Objectives and Scope**<br>
The ASAP Discovery Consortium is structured to be nimble and adapt to the integration of critical emerging technologies and external investigators and/or achieve greater understanding of target biology through the Developmental Project award program. Developmental Projects will be integrated into the projects or cores they are intended to accelerate or with which they will most closely interoperate.
 
ASAP Developmental Project proposals may consist of two types:
1. **Technology Integration Developmental Projects:** Developmental Projects with the potential to accelerate, improve throughput, or increase the success rates of existing projects or cores to allow ASAP to be agile and exploit emerging technologies in AI/ML, computational chemistry, automation, chemistry, etc.
2. **Target Biology Developmental Projects:** Developmental Projects target-enabling packages (TEPs) and chemical probes developed by ASAP to investigate complex target biology with the potential to enable ASAP to prosecute the target via novel resistance-robust modalities will be considered as independent, time-limited projects.

**Examples of Scientific Topics of Interest**<br>
* Fragment screening with cryo-EM
* Development of SARS-CoV-2 replicons for reverse genetics and deep mutational scanning in the presence of inhibitors
* Optimization of iPSC-derived primary-like systems for medium-throughput drug discovery
* Translationally relevant in vivo efficacy models to understand viral reservoirs and rebound
* Accelerating compound purification by building ML models from patent corpus
* Data-efficient machine learning models capable of predicting compound potency to protein targets from many viral family members
* Data analysis methods capable of extracting more insight from Biochemical or Antiviral Core data

**Proposal Review and Selection**<br>
Proposals will be reviewed and scored by the ASAP Discovery Consortium Scientific Advisory Board, Lead PIs, and relevant project and core leads. Selected applicants will participate in an interactive virtual pitch to further determine priority scoring. Investigators that are not currently part of the consortium will be asked to describe plans for integrating with the existing structure and ongoing work. Final selection will be made by NIH NIAID program staff. Selected projects will be required to complete NIH PHS398 application forms prior to funding and are subject to NIH approval. Funded Developmental Projects will be integrated into existing project/core leadership.

**Monitoring and Oversight**<br>
Relevant leadership will be responsible for Developmental Project progress oversight and assist with challenges and scientific direction. Expenditures will be monitored through subcontract invoicing.

**NOTE:** No clinical trials will be supported. Any involvement of human subjects must not entail more than minimal risk. If human subjects or vertebrate animals are involved, the appropriate sections described in the PHS 398 Instructions must be completed. Each application must also address plans for data sharing and, if applicable, biosafety concerns if selected to submit a formal application.
